  <title>Outlook</title>

  <para>Even if Extbase and Fluid are very powerful tools, there is an advance
  in development. In this chapter we would like to show an outlook of the
  current development. In the first section we will introduce the new
  Kickstarter for Extbase-Extensions, which will speed up the initial setup of
  an extension massivly. In the second section we will show you, not only how
  to write Fronted-Plugins with Extbase, but also how to write Backend-Modules
  with it. You can now make use of your accumulated knowlegde on Extbase and
  Fluid immediately. The chapter will be closed with an outlook on FLOW3,
  since Extbase is a bridging technology to FLOW3.</para>
