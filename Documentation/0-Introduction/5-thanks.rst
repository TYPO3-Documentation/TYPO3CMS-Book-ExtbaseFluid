Thanks
======

from Jochen and Sebastian
-------------------------
Above all, we want to thank our families and partners for their
understanding and their support when we spent our afternoons and evenings
with the book instead of with them. Also, our customers had to be patient
from time to time, when we developed Extbase or wrote the book instead
of working on their project.

TYPO3 would not exist without the dedication and vision of Kasper
Skårhøy and without the tireless work of all community members, especially
the TYPO3 core team. Here, we specifically want to thank the members who
discovered and implemented many future-proof technologies for TYPO3 v6.
Extbase would not be possible without this inspiration and
these guidelines.

Also when creating the book, we had generous support: a thank you
goes to Patrick Lobacher, as he wrote the section about Object
Oriented Programming.

Our special thanks goes to our editors, Alexandra Follenius and
Inken Kiupel, who gave us a lot of feedback and comments to our texts, and
thus had a great impact on the creating of this book. Also we want to
thank the many unknown helping hands at O'Reilly, who ultimately created
this book.

Additionally, you are right now reading the English version of this
book, so we want to thank our translators for the dedication and work they
have put into this project over the last months!

Last but not least, we want to thank you: That you want to use
Extbase and Fluid!
