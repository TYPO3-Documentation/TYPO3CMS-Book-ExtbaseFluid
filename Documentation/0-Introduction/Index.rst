Introduction
============

TYPO3 is a powerful and mature content management system containing many
features and a large degree of flexibility.

Extbase is a PHP-based framework which supports developers in
creating clean and easily maintainable TYPO3 extensions. The template
engine Fluid makes sure that the user interface
of the extension can easily be created individually.

Extbase ensures a clear separation between different concerns,
which makes maintenance a lot more simple thanks to modular code.
Because of this modular design, the development time and associated costs are
reduced for initial development and for adjustments. Extbase
also lessens the burden on the developer when it comes to security-relevant
and repetitive tasks:
for example the validation of arguments, the persistence of data,
and access to TypoScript and FlexForm settings. Developers can therefore focus
on solving the problems of their clients much more efficiently.

Using Extbase needs a basic understanding of concepts like domain driven
design, whilst planning and modeling the extension thoroughly before
implementation.
In return, the source code of the extension becomes a lot more readable,
more flexible and more extensible.
