Configuring the Server
======================

Since TYPO3 is written in the PHP scripting language, you will need a
webserver like Apache with PHP. For the appropriate PHP version, look at "system requirements" at the TYPO3 download page. (*https://get.typo3.org/*) Additionally TYPO3 requires a SQL database for data storage.
If you don't have a local development server yet, we recommend the XAMPP
package (*http://www.apachefriends.org/xampp.html*). It
will install Apache, PHP, MySQL and other useful tools on all established
operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X). Now you can install TYPO3 on
your test system.

For production systems you are advised to enable the PHP Opcode Cache.
