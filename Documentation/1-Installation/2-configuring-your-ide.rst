====================
Configuring your IDE
====================

We recommend to use a PHP development environment (IDE) like PhpStorm, Netbeans or Eclipse
instead of a simple editor. Along with
syntax highlighting, an IDE offers code completion and a
direct view of the code documentation. Some development environments also
have an integrated debugger, which makes detecting errors easier and faster.

Which development environment you use, is up to you, but PhpStorm
is widely used in the TYPO3 community.

We cannot cover the entire functionality of every IDE here. Refer
to the documentation for your IDE for further information.

Here are some general tips:

* Follow the TYPO3 :ref:`t3coreapi:cgl` and setup your IDE accordingly (e.g. PSR-2).

PhpStorm
========

In PhpStorm, you can create a project like
this:

#. Click on *File* â†’ *New Project from Existing Files...*
#. Follow the create project wizard.

The "TYPO3 Contribution Guide" contains some more information about
:ref:`PhpStorm Setup <t3contrib:phpstorm-setup>`.
The information is for core development, but you will find, the information
is useful for extension development as well.


Netbeans
========

The NetBeans IDE is offered for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. We use
NetBeans PHP, which you can download from
http://netbeans.org.

Eclipse
=======

Eclipse is also available for all important Operating Systems. The
PHP IDE is called Eclipse PDT, which you can download from
http://eclipse.org/pdt.
