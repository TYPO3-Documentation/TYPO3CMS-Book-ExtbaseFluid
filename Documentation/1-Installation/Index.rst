====================
Installation & setup
====================

To follow this documentation you need to have

1. :doc:`TYPO3 installed and running <t3start:Installation/Index>`,
2. the system extensions *Extbase* and *Fluid* and
3. the `Extension Builder <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/extension_builder>`__ extension installed.

The Extension Builder helps you to create and manage your Extbase and Fluid
based TYPO3 extensions by providing you a GUI.
But note that you should still familiarize yourself with the generated files
and their usage.
