Installation & setup
====================

To follow along with this documentation you need to have:

1. :doc:`TYPO3 installed and running <t3start:Installation/Index>`.
2. The system extensions *Extbase* and *Fluid* installed.
3. The `Extension Builder <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/extension_builder>`__ extension installed.

The Extension Builder helps you to create and manage your Extbase and Fluid
based extensions and comes with a backend administrative module.

Note that you should still familiarize yourself with the files that the Extension Builder
generates and their usage.
