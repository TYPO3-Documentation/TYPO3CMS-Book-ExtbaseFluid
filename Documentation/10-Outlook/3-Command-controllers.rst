===================
Command controllers
===================

Command controllers make functionality available on the command line
and in the scheduler backend module.

They can provide functionality for recurring tasks like mail queues, cleanups, imports and
more, which is then available for administrators and regular backend users.

Please see :ref:`t3coreapi:cli-mode` in "TYPO3 Explained" for more
information on command controllers.
