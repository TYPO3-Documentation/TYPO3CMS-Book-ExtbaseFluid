Outlook
=======

In this chapter we would like to show an outlook of further features. In the first section we will
introduce the new Kickstarter for Extbase-Extensions, which will speed up the initial setup of an
extension massively. In the second section we will show you, not only how to write Fronted-Plugins
with Extbase, but also how to write Backend-Modules and Commands with it. You can now make use of
your accumulated knowledge on Extbase and Fluid immediately.
