Conclusion
==========

In this chapter you have learned how to use the Model View Controller
Design Pattern, which divides the applications in the data model and
the user interaction, in Extbase.

Domain Driven Design and the MVC architecture form the conceptual backbone of
Extbase. Additionally, we recommend a look at test driven development
as a development paradigm, which lowers the probability of errors in
the code dramatically and structures the daily work of
developer even more.

With these base concepts you are perfectly prepared for the next chapters. Now
dive into the depths of Extbase with us!
