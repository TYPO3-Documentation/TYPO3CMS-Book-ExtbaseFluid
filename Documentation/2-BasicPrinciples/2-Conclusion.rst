Conclusion
==========

In this chapter, you have learned how to use the model–view–controller
design pattern, which divides the applications in the data model and
the user interaction, in Extbase.

Domain-driven design and the MVC architecture form the conceptual backbone of
Extbase. The test-driven development
paradigm means testing immediately after the development of a small component. It lowers the probability of errors in
the code dramatically and structures the daily work of
developers even more.

With understanding of these base concepts you are ready to dive into the depths of Extbase.
