In this chapter, you have learned how to use the model–view–controller
design pttern, which divides the applications in the data model and
the user interaction, in Extbase.

Domain-driven design and the MVC architecture form the conceptual backbone of
Extbase. Additionally, we recommend to look at the test-driven development
paradigm. It lowers the probability of errors in
the code dramatically and structures the daily work of
developers even more.

With these base concepts, you are perfectly prepared for the next chapters. Now
dive into the depths of Extbase with us!
