Conclusion
==========

In this chapter you have learned to the most important concepts of Extbase.
First, the basics of object-oriented programming have been refreshed, so that
you now have good knowledge to understand the programming style of Extbase.

Then you have been introduced to "Domain-Driven Design" which structures the
usually unstructed modelling process, and which focuses on the concepts that are
important for the domain. Since you usually discuss the domain logic with the
client, misunderstandings between the client and you as a developer are resolved
even quicker.

After that, we've looked into the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern, which
divides the applications in the data model and the user interaction.

Domain-Driven Design and the MVC architecture form the conceptual backbone of
Extbase. Now we have looked at Test-Driven Development as a development
paradigma, which lowers the probability of errors in the code dramatically and
structures the daily work of a developer even more.

With these base concepts you are perfectly prepared for the next chapters. Now
dive into the depths of Extbase with us!
