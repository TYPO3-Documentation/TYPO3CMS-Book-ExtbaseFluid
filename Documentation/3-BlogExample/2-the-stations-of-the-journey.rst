The stations of the journey
===========================================

Now that you have had a look at your journey destination and hopefully
don't feel disoriented when we stop at the several steps, you are now able
to start. Figure 3-3 gives you an overview of the stations on the journey,
which you will get to know more detailed in the upcoming sections.

    Figure 3-3: The several stations of the journey

When an extension like the blog example is called, the following
happens behind the scenes:

.. todo add refs to directly go to the sections

TYPO3 digs into the page content and discovers the content element of
the extension (plugin) on the page. It does not call the extension directly,
but hands over the control to the Extbase *Dispatcher*
(1).<remark>TODO: Add callouts</remark>

The *Dispatcher* bundles all information of the
request in a *Request* and sends it to the responsible
part of the extension, which takes over the flow control - the so called
*Controller* (2).

Within the controller the responsible storage room, which is in charge
of the blogs, - the *Repository* - is instructed to
return all the stored blogs using the method ``findAll()``
(3).

The *Repository* returns a collection of the
already made ``Blog`` objects with all of its posts, comments and
tags (4).

The *Controller* sends these blogs to the part of
the extension responsible for the output - the *View* -
and advises it to render the content in the requested output format
(5).

The *View* returns the rendered content
encapsulated in a *Response* back to the
*Dispatcher*, which on its turn returns the HTML code to
the calling TYPO3 process (6).
