=====================
The example extension
=====================

Our first extension will show an inventory list of products,
which we created in a backend list module.
Each product consists of a title,
a short description, and the number of pieces in stock.
The following steps are necessary for implementation:

#. Create directory tree and the minimal configuration files
#. Translate the problem domain to an abstract domain model
#. Configuration of the persistence layer


   * Define the database tables
   * Configure the display of backend forms
   * Create repositories for product objects

#. Define the application flow inside the extension (create *controller* and *action* methods)
#. Implement design with HTML-templates
#. Configure the plugin for list display
#. Install and test the extension
