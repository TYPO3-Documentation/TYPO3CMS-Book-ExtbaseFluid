Make Products Persistent
========================

From the class
:php:`\MyVendor\StoreInventory\Domain\Model\Product`, now we already can
generate instances – therefore concrete products with individual properties
– at script run time. These are available however only in volatile form in
the memory and are deleted by PHP after the page was produced completely by TYPO3.
So that the products are available over a longer time, we must
make it "permanent". Usually this happens in that they are stored into a
database. Therefore first of all we create the database table necessary for
that.

.. tip::

   The creating of the database tables can be done by the Extension Builder.

TYPO3 CMS will do this for us if we register the corresponding SQL
command in the file :file:`EXT:store_inventory/ext_tables.sql`:

.. code-block:: mysql

   CREATE TABLE tx_storeinventory_domain_model_product (
      uid int(11) unsigned DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL auto_increment,
      pid int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,

      name varchar(255) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL,
      description text NOT NULL,
      quantity int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,

      PRIMARY KEY (uid),
      KEY parent (pid)
   );

This SQL command designs a new table with the corresponding columns.
The columns ``uid`` and ``pid`` serve to the internal administration. Our product
characteristics ``name``, ``description`` and ``quantity`` appear as columns again.

The entries in the database are accessed by the Backend of
TYPO3. The forms of the Backend are produced on the basis of a
configuration, that is stored in a PHP array, the so-called
*Table-Configuration-Array* (shortly *TCA*).

.. tip::
   You find the documentation for the *Table-Configuration-Array* in the :ref:`TCA Reference <t3tca:start>`

Within the Extension we can access the data transparently by the repositories.
"Transparently" means that we don't have to think about the *type*
of the storage of the data when accessing the repositories.

So that the Backend know, how it should show the product data
in a form, we must configure this for the table in the file
:file:`EXT:store_inventory/Configuration/TCA/tx_storeinventory_domain_model_product.php`.

The file returns an array with the all information, that TYPO3 needs to render the list and detail view for the records of this extension.

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   return [
      'ctrl' => [
         'title' => 'LLL:EXT:store_inventory/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:tx_storeinventory_domain_model_product',
         'label' => 'name',
         'iconfile' => 'EXT:store_inventory/Resources/Public/Icons/Product.svg'
      ],
      'columns' => [
         'name' => [
            'label' => 'LLL:EXT:store_inventory/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:tx_storeinventory_domain_model_product.item_label',
            'config' => [
               'type' => 'input',
               'size' => '20',
               'eval' => 'trim'
            ],
         ],
         'description' => [
            'label' => 'LLL:EXT:store_inventory/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:tx_storeinventory_domain_model_product.item_description',
            'config' => [
               'type' => 'text',
               'eval' => 'trim'
            ],
         ],
         'quantity' => [
            'label' => 'LLL:EXT:store_inventory/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:tx_storeinventory_domain_model_product.stock_quantity',
            'config' => [
               'type' => 'input',
               'size' => '4',
               'eval' => 'int'
            ],
         ],
      ],
      'types' => [
         '0' => ['showitem' => 'name, description, quantity'],
      ],
   ];


This file comprises several sections. In the section ``ctrl``, basic characteristics are how the table name or the
statement which table column the label is supposed to be taken for the entries. In the section ``columns`` is described
for each table column how this in that is supposed to be shown in the Backend. The section type defines, in
which sequence the table columns are indicated, and like this where appropriate arranged.

To define the group name for the new record wizard for new records of this extension you have to use a language file
in the directory :file:`EXT:store_inventory/Resources/Private/Language/`. The identifier **extension.title** is
hard-coded in the TYPO3 core and you have to use this to define your own text.

.. tip::

   The possibilities to impact the TCA are immense.
   You can find a complete listing of all options at :ref:`TYPO3 Core APIs <t3coreapi:start>`.

.. attention::

   In TYPO3 7 the configuration was stored in the Array ``$GLOBALS['TCA']``
   in the file :file:`EXT:store_inventory/ext_tables.php`, but the TCA configuration was
   moved to a file with the database table name suffixed with the file extension *.php* as filename.
   So here the *Coding Guidelines* can't be applied, which says filenames has to be in *UpperCamelCase*.

   If you later want to overwrite the TCA from an existing database table, then you must use the file :file:`EXT:store_inventory/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/[tablename].php`.

After we installed the extension, we can create our first products in the backend.

Like shown in image 4-2, we create a sys folder that takes the products (see 1 in figure 4-2).
In this, we put some few new inventory data (see 2 in figure 4-2 and 3 in 4-3).

In this section we create a copy (or a model) of the reality, as we
transferred only a part of the properties of the real products in software,
that play a role in our domain. This model, which is abstracted of the real
world, is completely designed with this.

In order to access the objects created in the backend, we create
a Repository for the products. The
``MyVendor\StoreInventory\Domain\Repository\ProductRepository`` is an
object, in that the products are discarded. We can request a Repository to find all (or
certain) products and deliver it to us. The Repository class is very short
in our case:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php

   namespace MyVendor\StoreInventory\Domain\Repository;

   use TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Repository;

   /**
    * Class ProductRepository
    *
    * @package MyVendor\StoreInventory\Domain\Repository
    */
   class ProductRepository extends Repository
   {

   }

Our ``ProductRepository`` must be derived by
``\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Repository`` and inherits by this all methods. It can
remain empty therefore in our simple example. We put the class file
:file:`ProductRepository.php` into the directory :file:`EXT:store_inventory/Classes/Domain/Repository/`.
