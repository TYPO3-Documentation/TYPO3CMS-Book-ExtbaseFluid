====================
Controlling the flow
====================

We now want to show a list of products in our inventory in the frontend.
The component responsible for rendering that list is the *view*.
The default view and templating engine used in Extbase is Fluid.

The connection between the *model* and the *view* is the *controller*.
The controller is responsible for fetching the model's data and handing it
to the view to be rendered. The controller uses `*Action` methods as entry points.
In our case, we want to display a list of products, so we should implement a `listAction`.

.. index:: Controller

The Controller
==============

The class name of the controller must end with ``Controller``. Because our controller controls
the display of the inventory we call it :php:`\T3docs\StoreInventory\Controller\StoreInventoryController`.

In our simple example, the controller looks like this:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php

   namespace T3docs\StoreInventory\Controller;

   use T3docs\StoreInventory\Domain\Repository\ProductRepository;
   use TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Mvc\Controller\ActionController;
   use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

   class StoreInventoryController extends ActionController
   {
      private $productRepository;

      public function injectProductRepository(ProductRepository $productRepository)
      {
         $this->productRepository = $productRepository;
      }

      public function listAction(): ResponseInterface
      {
         $products = $this->productRepository->findAll();
         $this->view->assign('products', $products);
         return $this->htmlResponse();
      }
   }

.. versionchanged:: 11.0
   From version 11 on Extbase expects actions to return an instance
   of Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface.

.. index:: \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase; Mvc\Controller\ActionController

Our :php:`\T3docs\StoreInventory\Controller\StoreInventoryController` is derived from
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Mvc\Controller\ActionController`.
It only contains the method :php:`listAction()`.
Extbase identifies all methods ending with ``Action`` as actions
- entry points to our application.


.. index:: Repository; Injection

Injecting the repository
========================

The method :php:`injectProductRepository()` shows how dependency injection looks like in Extbase
- Extbase automatically injects the product repository via this method.
Afterward, we can access the repository with :php:`$this->productRepository` in all actions.
Use dependency injection for getting all your class dependencies if possible.


.. index::
   Repository; findAll()
   Repository; Fetching Models

Fetching the products from the repository
=========================================

As we want to display a list of all products in our inventory,
we can use the method :php:`findAll()` of the repository to fetch them.
:php:`findAll()` is  implemented in class :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Repository`, the parent class of our repository.


.. index::
   \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase; Persistence\Generic\QueryResult
   View; Assign
   View; Rendering

Assigning the view
==================

The repository returns a :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Generic\QueryResult`
object with all product objects (that are not hidden or deleted).
We pass these objects to the view with :php:`$this->view->assign(â€¦)`.
The view will automatically call :php:`render()` and return the rendered template.

.. code-block:: php

   return $this->view->render();
