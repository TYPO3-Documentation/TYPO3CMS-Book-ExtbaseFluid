Creating a first extension
===============================================

In this chapter you learn the basics of an extension based on extbase
and fluid. You build up a minimalistic extension, which is reduced to the
absolutely necessary structures. So you view clearly the whole, without
hassles with details. In the following chapters we will turn to a more
complex example, to cover exhaustively all fundamental attributes of extbase
and fluid.

You can get the extension here:
