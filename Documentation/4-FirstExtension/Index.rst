============================
Creating the first extension
============================

In this chapter, you learn the basics of an extension based on Extbase and Fluid.
You build a minimalistic extension, which is reduced to the necessary structures.
So you can get a first overview without being confused by details.
In the following chapters, we will turn to a more complex example,
to cover all fundamental attributes of Extbase and Fluid exhaustively.

You can get the extension here:
