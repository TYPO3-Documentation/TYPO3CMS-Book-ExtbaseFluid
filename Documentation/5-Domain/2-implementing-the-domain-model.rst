.. _implementing-the-domain-model:

Implementing the domain model
=============================

With the implementation of the domain there are two different approaches to:
From top to bottom or from the bottom to the top. In the first case you start
with those concepts, which include other or control them in the broadest sense.
In our example the organization comes into account, the contact name, address,
quotes, etc. "contains". In the second case, one starts with the basic concepts,
such as the age range, address or region. The decision affects one of the two
variants are on the way, how tests are written for the individual sections of
the code. Ultimately, this is a matter of taste. We opted for the approach from
top to bottom.

So we begin with the concept of organization. The file containing the class
definition we put into the folder EXT: sjr_offers/Classes/Domain/Model/ and
rename it according to the last part of the class name: Organization.php.

.. note::
    Using the abbreviation EXT: we cut off the part of the path that leads to the
    extension folder. For more information on possible locations of the extension
    folder, see Chapter 4

.. note::

    At this point in the development process, we find ourselves facing a fundamental
    decision: Should we develop our code secure by testing (using the method of
    test-driven development), or should we test only the final result? We know that
    the entry is in the method of test-driven development is a barrier. However, it
    is worthwhile to take the step because you will notice that you can increase
    your efficiency with TDD and save yourself a lot of frustrating experiences (eg
    in the painful search for an error). More information about the test-driven
    development, see chapter Chapter 2 in the section "Test-Driven Development". If
    you still decide to test only at the end, you can create the cycles of test
    development and skip the class in a train. We have cautioned, however.

First, we create the corresponding test class in the appropriate folder
Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_OrganizationTest EXT: sjr_offers/Tests /Domain
/Model/. After that we write our test.

::

    class OrganizationTest extends Tx_Extbase_BaseTestCase {

        /**
         * @test
         */
        public function anInstanceOfTheOrganizationCanBeConstructed() {
            $organization = new Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization('Name');
            $this->assertEquals('Name', $organization->getName());
        }
    }

.. note::

    In the folder Tests you can select the folder structure freely. We, however, we
    recommend you to build the same structure as in classes. With an increasing
    number of unit tests you will be able to remain focused.

Note that our test class extends the class
Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_OrganizationTest Tx_Extbase_BaseTestCase of Extbase.
Among other things, this class initializes the autoloader, which makes the
inclusion of the class files require_once() obsolete.

Remarkable is the remarkably long method name. Method names of this kind are
typical for Unit-Tests, because these names could be transformed into readable
sentences. So please formulate the method name so that it describes, which
result demonstrates a successful test. It gives you one (always current)
documentation of the functionality of your extension. The test is not able to
run because the appropriate class and its method get-Name() note yet exist. So
we create first a minimum trunk of the class and its methods.

::

    class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization {
        public function getName() {
        }
    }

The test is now able to run, but failed as expected (see Figure 5-5).

.. figure:: /Images/5-Domain/figure-5-5.jpg

    Figure 5-5: message of the failed first test run

Only now we add just enough code that the test is successful:

::

    class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization extends Tx_Extbase_DomainObject_AbstractEntity{
        /**
        * @var string The name of the organization
        **/
        protected $name;
        public function __construct($name) {
            $this->name = $name;
        }
        public function getName() {
            return $this->name;
        }
    }

.. sidebar:: Test-Driven Development at a glance

    This approach is typical of the Test-Driven Development (see chapter 2, section »Test-Driven
    Development«). So once again summarized the essential steps:

    #. Create a unit test and possibly a test class.
    #. Implement classes and methods just as much that the script runs through
       without syntax or run-time error ("Fatal Error").
    #. Let the unit test fails ( at this time we have not implemented any code for
       the solution of this step).
    #. Implement a minimal solution.
    #. Run the test again and if it is necessary make the implementation better.
    #. After a successful test-run, go to the next code to be implemented.

Currently, the name can only be set during the instantiation of the class,
because only at this moment the Constructor __construct() is called. Because it
should be possible at a later moment to change the name, we introduce a public
method setName($name) with the according test. Note also that we have slightly
modified the code in the constructor. We now use instead of the direct
$this->name = $name the respective Setter. In the comment about the definition
of property $name,the type of property is specified. In our case the name of the
String. Thereby our class looks like as follows:

::

    class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization {
        /**
        * @var string The name of the organization
        **/
        protected $name;
        public function __construct($name) {
            $this->setName($name);
        }
        public function setName($name) {
            $this->name = $name;
        }
        public function getName() {
            return $this->name;
        }
    }

Now we implement step by step the class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization –
always protected by our tests. Here we meet the requirement that there can be
multiple contact persons. We want to keep ready in the capacity of contacts. So
we set there a Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage, which later takes the
instances of the class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person (or more precisely, the
references to instances).

But the test at first:

::

    /**
    * @test
    */
    public function theContactsAreInitializedAsEmptyObjectStorage() {
        $organization = new Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization('Youth Organization');
        $this->assertEquals('Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage',
        get_class($organization->getContacts()));
        $this->assertEquals(0, count($organization->getContacts()));
    }

The contact person should be an instance of the class
Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person. Since this class does not exist, one could
make the next working to implement them. Thus we would probably get bogged down
and jump from one class to the other. When writing unit tests can be upheld in
so-called Mocks back. A mock is an object that can behave as if it were another.
To "mock" an objects means to create a replacement object in targeted areas
which will behave like the target object. Lets take a look at the test as an
example:

::

    /**
    * @test
    */
    public function aContactCanBeAdded() {
        $organization = new Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization('Youth Organization');
        $mockContact = $this->getMock('Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person');
        $organization->addContact($mockContact);
        $this->assertTrue($organization->getContacts()->contains($mockContact));
    }

The variable $mockContact contains the object, which behaves like an instance of
the class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person. Because of this we can now use the
two methods addContact() and implement getContacts ():

::

    /**
     * @var Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage<Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person>
     *  The contacts of the organization
     */
    protected $contacts;

    /**
     * Adds a contact to the organization
     *
     * @param Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person The contact to be added
     * @return void
     */
    public function addContact(Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person $contact) {
        $this->contacts->attach($contact);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the contacts of the organization
     *
     * @return Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage<Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person>
     * The contacts of the organization
     */
    public function getContacts() {
        return clone $this->contacts;
    }

The comment about the definition of property is $contacts of crucial importance.
Extbase "reads" the comment and concludes of it, that an ObjectStorage should be
created and from which class the objects should which are in it included (also
see chapter 3). Omission of this information would lead to a PHP exception:
»Could not determine the type of the contained objects«.

Another special feature is the key word clone. With clone the method
getContacts()  clones the ObjectStorage before returning to the caller. Cloning
causes that the objects are copied within the ObjectStorageand the reference to
the original contacts is deleted. This is necessary because the caller does not
know that it gets delivered a ObjectStorage instead of a PHP array. Would the
caller manipulate now the containing objects without using the keyword clone, he
would change the original data by accident.

In this section you could use the procedure for Test-Driven Development to meet.
If you use in your development practice this procedure, you will be rewarded
with a good feeling, to write code which is always functional - or at least
compliant as expected. In English, one can use the expression »green bar
feeling« (siehe Abbildung 5-6). In the course we will not explicitly deal with
the testing. But we use it always in the background.

.. figure:: /Images/5-Domain/figure-5-6.jpg

    Figure 5-6: By the test-driven development there is a residual »Green-Bar-Feeling«.

.. _implementing-relationships-between-domain-objects:

Implementing relationships between domain objects
---------------------------------------------------

Extbase supports three different types of hierarchical relationship between domain objects.

1:1-relationship
An offer has in our case, exactly one period in which it is valid. The object
Offer gets therefore a property timePeriod, that is exactly referenced one time
to the object TimePeriod.

1:n-relationship
An organization can have multiple contacts. The object Organization therefore
gets the property contacts that refers to any number of Contact objects.

m:n-relationship
An offer on the one hand could be assigned to different categories. On the other
hand, offers could be assigned to one category. Therefore receives the Offer
object categories as a property.

.. note::

    In addition to these relations an n: 1 relationship is often used: A company has
    a representative, a representative can work for several companies. In Extbase
    such a relationship is always mapped by an m: n relationship in which the number
    of child objects (agents) from the perspective of a parent object (enterprise)
    is limited to just one.

In a 1:1 relationship set and get methods are implemented. At the polyhydric 1:n
and m:n relationships the add and remove methods are added.

::

    setContacts(Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage $contacts)
    getContacts()
    addContact(Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Contact $contact)
    removeContact(Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Contact $contact)

Be careful about the subtle differences here. The methods and setContacts
getContacts refer simultaneously to all contacts. They expect and hence provide
an ObjectStorage. The methods addContact and removeContact refer to a single
Contact-Object that is added to the list or removed from. To extract a single
contact from the list, let us first bring all contacts with getContacts() and
then draw on the methods of the ObjectStorage to individual contacts.

The property offers, we proceed to the equivalent property contacts. The
definition of the property offers includes in the comment two special
annotations:
@lazy and @cascade remove.

::

    /**
    * @var Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage<Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Offer>
    *      The offers the organization has to offer
    * @lazy
    * @cascade remove
    **/
    protected $offers;

By default Extbase invites all child objects with the parent object (so for
example all offers of an organization). This behavior is called Eager-Loading.
The annotation @lazy causes Extbase to load the objects and build only when they
are actually needed (lazy loading). This can be an appropriate data structure,
eg many organizations, each with very many offers, that lead to a significant
increase in speed.

.. note::

    Beware, however, against all the properties provided by child objects with
    @lazy, because this can lead to frequent loading of child objects. The ensuing,
    small-scaled database accesses reduces the performance and cause then the exact
    opposite of what you wanted to achieve with the lazy-loading.

The annotation @cascade remove causes if the organization is deleted, the offers
will be also deleted immediately. Extbase leaves usually persist unchanged all
child objects.

.. note::

    In FLOW3 in this behavior is slightly different. Here child objects to which no
    more can be accessed from a repository, are automatically deleted. In TYPO3 4.x,
    you can definitely still access the orphaned objects at the backend.

Besides these two there are a few more annotations available, which will be used
in other contexts (eg in the controller). The complete list of all by Extbase
supported annotations, see the index.

So far, the impression may arise that domain models consist only of setters and
getters. The domain objects, however, contain the main part of the business
logic. In the following section, we add to our class
Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization a small part of this business logic.

.. _adding-business-logic-to-the-domain-objects:

Adding business logic to the domain objects
--------------------------------------------

Part in deciding which part of the business logic belongs to a particular domain
model, you can be guided by what questions we can ask the domain object in the
"real" world. We can ask the organization for the list of all contacts, for
example. So we implement a method getAllContacts(). In contrast to the
previously implemented method getContacts() this should deliver in addition to
these direct contacts of the organization but also provide the contact for all
services. For this the organization has to pass through all their offerings and
add one if there is a existing contact to the result. This is especially useful
for administrators of an organization. The implementation is as follows:

::

    public function getAllContacts() {
        $contacts = $this->getContacts();
        foreach ($this->getOffers() as $offer) {
            $contact = $offer->getContact();
            if (is_object($contact)) {
                $contacts->attach($contact);
            }
        }
        return $contacts;
    }

The organization gets first by using getContacts() their direct contact.
Therefore all the offers are iterated with foreach. The query is_object() is
necessary because the offer returns NULL if a contact is missing. The contact
person of the offer will be added to the ObjectStorage as the variable
$contacts. At this point it becomes clear how important is the keyword clone of
the method getContacts(). If the ObjectStorage would not have been cloned, we
would add all the contacts of the offers of the organization as primary
contacts. In addition, we benefit here by a special property of the
ObjectStorage: It takes one and the same object only once. If it had not this
quality, a person who is assigned to multiple offers, would appear more than
once in the list.

.. note::

    Alternatively to the method getAllOffers() in the domain object Organization,
    you could have also implement a method in an OfferRepository
    findAllContacts($organization). There it would have been possible to get the
    offers by a little bit more complex query direct from the database. But we
    follow the important basic rule of the Domain-Driven Design at this place, which
    says that a element of an aggregate (the totality of all the terms contained in
    the organization) should be accesssed by the root object (Aggregate-Root). The
    alternative we choose only, if the iterating through all the offers causes
    actually a performance problem.

We finish that implementation of the class from
Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization and turn to the class
Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Offer. The basic approach here is not fundamentally
different from the last. Let's take a look at the (shortened) class which
emphasizes some peculiarities.

::

    class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Offer extends Tx_Extbase_DomainObject_AbstractEntity {
        /**
        * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization The organization of the offer
        **/
        protected $organization;
        protected $title;
        protected $image;
        protected $teaser;
        protected $description;
        protected $services;
        protected $dates;
        protected $venue;
        /**
        * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_AgeRange The age range of the offer.
        **/
        protected $ageRange;
        /**
        * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_DateRange The date range of the offer.
        **/
        protected $dateRange;
        /**
        * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_AttendanceRange The attendance range.
        **/
        protected $attendanceRange;
        /**
        * @var Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage<Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_
        AttendanceFee>
        **/
        protected $attendanceFees;
        /**
        * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person The contact of the offer
        **/
        protected $contact;
        /**
        * @var Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage<Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Category>
        The categories the offer is assigned to
        **/
        protected $categories;
        /**
        * @var Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage<Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Region>
        The regions the offer is available
        **/
        protected $regions;
        /**
        * @param string $title The title of the offer
        */
        public function __construct($title) {
            $this->setTitle($title);
            $this->setAttendanceFees(new Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage);
            $this->setCategories(new Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage);
            $this->setRegions(new Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage);
        }
        // Getter and Setter
    }

The property organization of the object Offer includes a back reference of the
offering organization. We have introduced them to have later a quick access at
the collection of all the offers on the organization. Thus, we deviate slightly
from the pure "doctrine" from the Domain-Driven Design. This means, among other
things, that you access the child object Offer only on the root object
Organization (Aggregate Root) should.

.. note::

    The back reference in the form of property organization is similar in some
    aspects to the foreign key organization in the database table
    tx_sjroffers_domain_model_offer. This foreign key contains the uid and links the
    offer-tuple associated with the corresponding tuple from the table
    tx_sjroffers_domain_model_organization. We use here sent from the fact that the
    integer value of the uid is converted by Extbase because of the annotation @var
    Tx_Sjr Offers_Domain_Model_Organization into the corresponding object
    Organization.

The properties ageRange, dateRange and attendanceRange contains the objects of
the type RangeConstraint. These classes we have to create at first and had
created mocks for the in our tests.

Then we add the class to the necessary getters and setters. Even class
internally it is advisable to access using setter and getter. So there (maybe
later) the actual code is used before the setting of the property value is done.
The title which is passed to the constructor is not set by $this-> title =
$title, but by $this->setTitle($title).

The objects that are kept at the properties attendanceFees, categories and
regions, we set off in an object storage. At the three properties so we
initialize an empty ObjectStorage each in the constructor.

.. _use-inheritance-in-class-hierarchies:

Use inheritance in class hierarchies
-------------------------------------

The domain objects and their relationships can be mapped generally good in a
tree hierarchy. Such a hierarchy can be find in figure 5-2. Organisations
include Offers. In turn, offers "contained" small fees. In our domain model is
however, a second kind of hierarchy: the class hierarchy. In this hirarchy we
have set that the objects ageRange, dateRange and attendanceRange are a
concretization. They inherit properties and methods. In modelling we consider
the opposite approach: You have to search properties which are in common in that
objects. This may be abstracted and then stores them in a new, higher-level
class out. In Figure 5-7 and Figure 5-8, we have shown again the procedure
separately.

.. figure:: /Images/5-Domain/figure-5-7.png

    Figure 5-7: Creating the Range Constraints

.. figure:: /Images/5-Domain/figure-5-8.png

    Figure 5-8: Abstraction of the properties and the shift in RangeConstraint

In the class Range Constraint all common properties and methods are gathered. The properties
minimumValue and maximumValue are of the type integer by default. But the inherited class DateRange
expected as property values not Numbers, but objects of type DateTime. So we »override« the type
definition in the class DateRange and set the type DateTime. The class RangeConstraint looks like as
follows (Comments were partly removed):

::

    abstract class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_RangeConstraint extends Tx_Extbase_DomainObject_AbstractValueObject {
        /**
        * @var int The minimum value
        **/
        protected $minimumValue;
        /**
        * @var int The maximum value
        **/
        protected $maximumValue;
        /**
        * @param int $minimumValue
        * @param int $maximumValue
        */
        public function __construct($minimumValue = NULL, $maximumValue = NULL) {
            $this->setMinimumValue($minimumValue);
            $this->setMaximumValue($maximumValue);
        }
        /**
        * @param mixed The minimum value
        * @return void
        */
        public function setMinimumValue($minimumValue = NULL) {
            $this->minimumValue = $this->normalizeValue($minimumValue);
        }
        public function getMinimumValue() {
            return $this->minimumValue;
        }
        /**
        * @param mixed The maximum value
        * @return void
        */
        public function setMaximumValue($maximumValue = NULL) {
            $this->maximumValue = $this->normalizeValue($maximumValue);
        }
        public function getMaximumValue() {
            return $this->maximumValue;
        }
        public function normalizeValue($value = NULL) {
            if ($value !== NULL && $value !== '') {
            $value = abs(intval($value));
        } else {
            $value = NULL;
        }
        return $value;
        }
    }

All of this range objects have beyond their properties and methods further things in common. They
have no identity other than the whole of their property values. It is not important for the offer,
which age range »from 12 till 15 years« the range object is assigned to receive. Of importance
isonly the two values 12 and 15. Are two offers designed for the same age range, so Extbase must
therefore do not pay attention to the fact that it assigns a particular age range with the values 12
and 15 to the offer. Value Objects can e.g. occur multiple times in memory, and therefore any be
copied while it was driving in the major entities of the ambiguity problem. The internal handling is
much more easier because of this. We thus have to Extbase to treat the object as a Value Object
Constraint Range by inheriting from the appropriate Extbase class: extends
Tx_Extbase_DomainObject_Abstract-ValueObject.

The class rank by the keyword abstract constraint was marked as abstract. Thus we prevent the Range
object itself is instantiated.

We have furthermore implement a method normalizeValue(). These »adjusted« the values
coming from the outside before they are assigned to a property. This is overwritten in
the class DateRange together with the above mentioned type definitions:

::

 class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_DateRange extends Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_RangeConstraint
 implements Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_DateRangeInterface {
    /**
    * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_DateTime The minimum value
    **/
    protected $minimumValue;
    /**
    * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_DateTime The maximum value
    **/
    protected $maximumValue;
    public function normalizeValue($value = NULL) {
        if (!($value instanceof DateTime)) {
            $value = NULL;
        }
    return $value;
    }
 }

The class DateRange implements furthermore the interface DateRangeInterface. The interface on is own
is empty and is only used for identification. This makes especially sense for the other two Range
Objects. These both implent the NumericRangeInterface. The classes AgeRange and AttendanceRange
Classes are otherwise empty hulls, because they inherit all the properties and methods from the
object RangeConstraint.

::

 class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_AgeRange extends Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_RangeConstraint
 implements Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_NumericRangeInterface {
 }
 class Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_AttendanceRange extends Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_RangeConstraint
 implements Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_NumericRangeInterface {
 }
 interface Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_NumericRangeInterface {}

 interface Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_DateRangeInterface {}

We have implemented the terms age range, number of participants and offer an adequate period in
domain models.Let us now turn to the object administrator. Also here we use another, less obvious
class hierarchy. Extbase provides two domain models available: FrontendUser and FrontendUserGroup.
They are the equivalents of the website user or user group's website, created in the backend of
TYPO3 can be assigned and managed. The two Extbase classes are filled with this data, which are
stored in two database tables or fe_users fe_groups. The database fields in these tables each have a
corresponding property in the domain model. The names of the properties were indeed subjected to the
convention that the field names lower_underscore spelling in the name of the property is converted
into lowerCamelCase notation. But they are otherwise taken 1:1 and therefore - in contrast to our
previous practice - not so meaningful. Behind the property isOnline we would suspect a value of the
type Boolean. But it contains the date on which the website has started the last page user demand.

Validate the domain objects
----------------------------
The business logic often looks for rules as to the properties of the data domain objects
needs to be. Here are some examples of such so-called invariants in our
Extension:

* The length of the title of an offer must not be under 3 characters and not over 50 characters.
* The start date of an offer may not be later than the end date.
* If one partner identifies an e-mail address, it must be valid.

You can implement the check of the details of these invariants directly the domain model. In the
setter of the title of an offer would stand the following code:

::

 public function setTitle($title) {
    if (strlen($title) > 3 && strlen($title) < 50) {
        $this->title = $title;
    }
 }

This has several disadvantages:

* This examination, had to be done at any point, which manipulates the title (risk of failure to
  examination, and risk of duplicated code by cut-and-paste).
* The definition of the rule is more or less far away from the definition of the property (poor
  readability of the code).
* A change in an option of a rule ("80 rather than 50 characters") requires an intervention possibly
  at a difficult to-find places.

Therefore Extbase offers an alternative about Annotations. Let us have a look at the definitions of
the properties of the class Offer definition - this time with all the comments:

::

    /**
    * @var string The title of the offer
    * @validate StringLength(minimum = 3, maximum = 50)
    **/
    protected $title;

    /**
    * @var string A single image of the offer
    **/
    protected $image;

    /**
    * @var string The teaser of the offer. A line of text.
    * @validate StringLength(maximum = 150)
    **/
    protected $teaser;

    /**
    * @var string The description of the offer. A longer text.
    * @validate StringLength(maximum = 2000)
    **/
    protected $description;

    /**
    * @var string The services of the offer.
    * @validate StringLength(maximum = 1000)
    **/
    protected $services;

    /**
    * @var string The textual description of the dates. E.g. "Monday to Friday, 8-12"
    * @validate StringLength(maximum = 1000)
    **/
    protected $dates;

    /**
    * @var string The venue of the offer.
    * @validate StringLength(maximum = 1000)
    **/
    protected $venue;

    /**
    * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_AgeRange The age range of the offer.
    * @validate Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Validator_RangeConstraintValidator
    **/
    protected $ageRange;

    /**
    * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_DateRange The date range of the offer is valid.
    * @validate Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Validator_RangeConstraintValidator
    **/
    protected $dateRange;

    /**
    * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_AttendanceRange The attendance range of the offer.
    * @validate Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Validator_RangeConstraintValidator
    **/
    protected $attendanceRange;

    /**
    * @var Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage<Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_AttendanceFee>
    The attendance fees of the offer.
    **/
    protected $attendanceFees;

    /**
    * @var Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Person The contact of the offer
    **/
    protected $contact;

    /**
    * @var Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage<Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Category>
    The categories the offer is assigned to
    **/
    protected $categories;

    /**
    * @var Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage<Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Region>
    The regions the offer is available
    **/
    protected $regions;

The values of some properties must be checked to control the offer being classified as valid. Which
rule will narrow, about the annotation @ validate [...] is set. The annotation @validate
StringLength (minimum = 3, maximum = 50) on the property title effected, for example, that the title
length is not smaller than 3 characters and not longer than 50 characters.  The validator
StringLength is provided by Extbase of charge. The name of the associated class is
Tx_Extbase_Validation_Validator_StringLengthValidator. The options minimum and maximum are passed to
the Validator and are evaluated there.

With the validation, we conclude the modeling and implementation of the domain at first. With that
achieved, it is possible to store domain objects, which where generated during a page view in
memory. All data will be lost at the end of the page view. In order for the domain objects are
permanently on the grouting, the persistence layer is to be set up accordingly.
