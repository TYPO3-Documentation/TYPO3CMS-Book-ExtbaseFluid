Individual Database Queries
===========================

The previous descriptions about generic methods of queries to a Repository are
sufficient for simple use-cases. However, there are many cases where they are
not adequate and require more flexible solutions. On the requirements list of
our application is the functionality to print a list of all the offers. In
natural language this would sound as follows:

* "Find all the offers for a certain region."
* "Find all the offers corresponding to a certain category."
* "Find all the offers containing a certain word."
* "Find offers that are associated to a selected set of organizations."

There are principally two ways of implementing such methods. On the one hand you
could request all the offers from the Backend and filter them manually. On the
other hand you could use a certain request matching exactly your criteria and
just execute it. Contrary to the first case, the latter method would only build
the objects that are really needed which positively affects the performance of
your application. Therefore, the first method is more flexible and easier to
implement.

.. note::

    You may start developing your application using the first method and then,
    seeing your application growing, veering to the second method. Luckily, all
    the changes are encapsulated in the Repository and you therefore don't have
    to change any code out of the Persistence Backend.

You can use Extbase's *Query*-object for implementing individual queries by
giving it all the essential information needed for a qualified request to the
database backend. Those information contain:

* The request's class (*Type*) to which the request applies.
* An (optional) *Constraint* which restricts the result set.
* (Optional) Parameters which configure a section of the result set by a *limit* or an *offset*.
* (Optional) Parameters concerning the *Orderings* of the result set.

Within a Repository you can create a Query object by using the command
``$this->createQuery()``. The Query object is already customized to the class
which is managed by the Repository. Thus, the result set only consists of
objects of that class, i.e. it consists of Offer objects within the
``OfferRepository``. After giving all needed information to the Query object
(detailed information will be given later on) you execute the request by using
``execute()`` which returns a sorted Array with the properly instantiated
objects (or a via limit and offset customized section of it). For example, the
generic method ``findAll()`` looks as follows::

    public function findAll() {
        return $this->createQuery()->execute();
    }

In this simple first use-case we don't any constraining parameter to the Query
object. However, we have to define such a parameter to implement the first
specified request "Find all the offers for a certain region". Thus, the
corresponding method looks as follows::

    public function findInRegion(Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Region $region) {
        $query = $this->createQuery();
        $query->matching($query->contains('regions', $region));
        return $query->execute();
    }

Using the method ``matching()`` we give the Query the following condition: The
property *regions* of the object *Offer* (which is managed by the Repository)
should contain the region that is referenced by the variable ``$region``. The
method ``contains()`` returns a *Constraint* object. The Query object has some
other methods each of which returns a *Constraint* object. Those methods may be
roughly splitted into two groups: Comparing operations and Boolean operations.
The first mentioned lead to a comparison between the value of a given property
and another operand. The latter mentioned operations connect two conditions to
one condition by the rules of Boolean Algebra and may negate a result
respectively. Following Comparing operations are acceptable::

    equals($propertyName, $operand, $caseSensitive = TRUE)
    in($propertyName, $operand)
    contains($propertyName, $operand)
    like($propertyName, $operand)
    lessThan($propertyName, $operand)
    lessThanOrEqual($propertyName, $operand)
    greaterThan($propertyName, $operand)
    greaterThanOrEqual($propertyName, $operand)

The method ``equals()`` executes a simple comparison between the property's
value and the operand which may be a simple PHP data type or a Domain object.

Contrary, the methods ``in()`` and ``contains()`` accept multi-value data types
as arguments (e.g. Array, ObjectStorage). As ``in()`` checks if a single-valued
property exists in a multi-value operand, the latter method ``contains()``
checks if a multi-valued property contains a single-valued operand. The opposite
of the introduced method ``findInRegion()`` is ``findOfferedBy()`` which accepts
a multi-valued operand (``$organizations``).

::

    public function findOfferedBy(array $organizations) {
        $query = $this->createQuery();
        $query->matching($query->in('organization', $organizations));
        return $query->execute();
    }

.. note::

    The methods ``in()`` and ``contains()`` were introduced in Extbase version
    1.1. If you pass an empty multi-valued property value or an empty
    multi-valued operand (e.g. an empty Array) to them you always get a *false*
    as return value for the test. Thus you have to prove if the operand
    ``$organizations`` of the method call ``$query->in('organization',
    $organizations)`` contains sane values or if it is just an empty Array. This
    is dependent on your domain logic. In the last example the method
    ``findOfferedBy()`` would return an empty set of values.


It's possible to use comparison operators that are reaching deep into the tree
of object hierarchy. Let's assume you want to filter the organizations whether
they have offers for youngsters older than 16. You may define the request in the
``OrganizationRepository`` as follows::

    $query->lessThanOrEqual('offers.ageRange.minimalValue', 16)

Extbase solves the path ``offers.ageRange.minimalValue`` by seeking every
organization which has offers whose age values have a minimum which is less or
equal 16. Assuming that a Relational Database System is used in the Persistence
Backend, this is internally solved by a so-called *INNER JOIN*. All relational
types (1:1, 1:n, m:n) and all comparison operators are covered by this feature.

.. note::

    The path notation was introduced in Extbase 1.1 and is derived from the
    *Object-Accessor* notation of Fluid (see Ch. 8). In Fluid you may access
    object properties with the notation ``{organization.administrator.name}``.
    However, Fluid does not support the notation
    ``{organization.offers.categories.title}`` whereas
    ``$query->equals('offers.categories.title', 'foo')`` is possible die to the
    limitation in Fluid that the access of properties is not possible in a
    "concatenated way".

Besides of the comparison operators the ``Query`` object supports Boolean
Operators like::

    logicalAnd($constraint1, $constraint2)
    logicalOr($constraint1, $constraint2)
    logicalNot($constraint)

The methods above return a ``Constraint`` object. The resulting ``Constraint``
object of ``logicalAnd()`` is true if both given params ``$constraint1`` and
``$constraint2`` are true whereas it's sufficient when using ``logicalOr()`` to
be true if only one of the given params is true. Since Extbase 1.1 both methods
accept an Array of constraints. Last but not least, the function
``logicalNot()`` inverts the given ``$constraing`` to it's opposite, i.e. *true*
gets *false* and *false* gets *true*. Given this information, you can create
complex queries like::

    public function findMatchingOrganizationAndRegion(Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization $organization, Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Region $region) {
        $query = $this->createQuery();
        $query->matching(
            $query->logicalAnd(
                $query->equals('organization', $organization),
                $query->contains('regions', $region)
            )
        )
        return $query->execute();
    }

The method ``findMatchingOrganizationAndRegion()`` returns those offers that
match both the given organization and the given region.

For our example extension we have the complex specification, to find all offers,
that are comply with the requirements of the user. The requirements are given
by the information about the age, the organization, the city district, the category
as well as a free defined search term in the front end. We encapsulate the requirements
in an own ``Demand`` object, that basically consists of the properties ``age``, ``organisation``,
``region``, ``category`` and ``searchWord`` plus their getter and setter.
In addition to the restrictions for the needs of the user there comes the request
to show the current offers. That denotes that their end date at most are one week ago.
In the method ``findDemanded()`` of the ``offerRepository`` the request is implemented::

    public function findDemanded(Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Demand $demand) {
        $query = $this->createQuery();
        $constraints = array();
        if ($demand->getRegion() !== NULL) {
            $constraints[] = $query->contains('regions', '$demand->getRegion());
        }
        if ($demand->getCategory() !== NULL) {
            $constraints[] = $query->contains('categories', $demand->getCategory());
        }
        if ($demand->getOrganization() !== NULL) {
            $constraints[] = $query->contains('organization', $demand->getOrganization());
        }
        if (is_string($demand->getSearchWord()) && strlen($demand->getSearchWord()) > 0) {
            $constraints[] = $query->like($propertyName, '%' . $demand->getSearchWord . '%');
        }
        if ($demand->getAge() !== NULL) {
            $constraints[] = $query->logicalAnd(
                $query->logicalOr(
                    $query->equals('ageRange.minimumValue', NULL),
                    $query->lessThanOrEqual('ageRange.minimumValue', $demand->getAge())
                ),
                $query->logicalOr(
                    $query->equals('ageRange.maximumValue', NULL),
                    $query->greaterThanOrEqual('ageRange.maximumValue', $demand->getAge())
                ),
            );
        }
        $constraints[] = $query->logicalOr(
            $query->equals('dateRange.minimumValue', NULL),
            $query->equals('dateRange.minimumValue', 0),
            $query->greaterThan('dateRange.maximumValue', (time() - 60*60*24*7))
        );
        $query->matching($query->logicalAnd($constraints));
        return $query->execute();
    }

The ``Demand`` object is passed as argument. In the first lien the ``Query`` object is created.
All single constraint terms are collected in the array ``$constraints`` and finally brought
together with the bool operator ``AND`` via ``$query->logicalAnd($constraints)``. This is
assigned to the ``Query`` object via ``matching()``. With ``return $query->execute();`` the
located ``Offer`` objects are returned to the caller. Interesting is the implementation of the
condition that the specified age must be inside the range of the offer. There must also shown
the offers without given minimum or maximum age.

::

    $constraints[] = $query->logicalAnd(
        $query->logicalOr(
            $query->equals('ageRange.minimumValue', NULL),
            $query->lessThanOrEqual('ageRange.minimumValue', $demand->getAge())
        ),
        $query->logicalOr(
            $query->equals('ageRange.maximumValue', NULL),
            $query->greaterThanOrEqual('ageRange.maximumValue', $demand->getAge())
        ),
    );

This requirement is fulfilled by allowing a not set age (``NULL``) and concatenate this condition
with ``logicalOr()`` with the condition ``lessThanOrEqual()`` and accordingly ``greaterThenOrEqual()``.

You can sort the result of a query by assigning one or more rules
``$query->setOrderings($orderings);`` to the ``Query`` object. These rules are collected in an
associative array. The name of the property depending the sort is used as key and the search order
is the value of the array element.  There are two constants fo the search order:
``Tx_Extbase_Persistence_QueryInterface:ORDER_ASCENDING`` for an ascending order and
``Tx_Extbase_Persistence_QueryInterface:ORDER_DESCENDING`` for a descending order. A complete sample
for specifying a sort order looks like this::

    $query->setOrderings(
        array(
            'organization.name' => Tx_Extbase_Persistence_QueryInterface::ORDER_ASCENDING,
            'title' => Tx_Extbase_Persistence_QueryInterface:ORDER_ASCENDING
        )
    );

Multiple orderings are processed in the specified order. In our sample the offers are ordered first
by the name of the organization and inside the organization by the title of the offers in ascending
order (thus from A to Z). Since Extbase 1.1 you can use the practical point notation for the
specification of the properties to sort for.

If you need only an extract of the result set, you can lower this with the two parameters ``Limit``
and ``Offset``. Assumed you want to get the 10. up to 30. offer from the complete result from the
repository you can achieve it with the following lines::

    $query->setOffset(10);
    $query->setLimit(20);

Both methods expects an integer value. With the method ``setOffset()`` you set the pointer to the
object you will start with. With the method ``setLimit()`` you set the count of objects you will get
(at maximum).

At first the usage of a ``Query`` object with ``Constraint`` objects instead of direct written
SQL statements looks very inefficient. But it makes a complete abstraction of the used storage
solution possible. FLOW3 also uses a ``Query`` object with identical API. With this the code
for the query is easily to port to FLOW3.

.. note::

    The ``Query`` object lean against the *Java Specification Request* (JSR) 283. The JSR 283
    describe and standardised a content repository for Java, that is also used by FLOW3 and is
    ported to PHP ba the FLOW3 team. More information about this you find at
    :file:`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283`.

Using the method ``statement()`` of the ``Query`` object you can send a native SQL statement to
the database.

::

    $result = $query->statement('SELECT * FROM tx_sjroffers_domain_model_offer
        WHERE title LIKE ? AND organization IN ?', array('%climbing%', array(33,47)));

is translated by Extbase to the following query::

    SELECT * FROM tx_sjroffers_domain_model_offer WHERE title LIKE '%climbing%' AND
        organization IN ('33','47')

.. warning::

    You should always avoid to take queries to the persistence layer out of the domain model.
    Encapsulate these always in a repository.

    Inside of the repositories you can access the database using the API of TYPO3 4.x
    (so for example with ``$GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->exec_SELECTgetRows([...])``). You have to
    handle the creation and maintenance of the objects by yourself.

    The method ``statement()`` is not part of the FLOW3 API. If you want to port your extension later
    to FLOW3 you have to assign these calls manually. The same also applies when using the TYPO3 4.x API.

The method ``execute()`` per default returns a complete ready build object and the related objects
- the complete *Aggregate*. In some cases it is convenient to preserve the "raw data" of the objects,
e.g. if you want to manipulate them before you build objects out of them. For this you have to change
the settings of the ``Query`` object.

::

    $query->getQuerySettings()->setReturnRawQueryResult(TRUE);

The method ``execute()`` returns than - since Extbase 1.2 - a multidimensional array with the object data.
Inside an object one differ single value properties, multi value properties and NULL values. Lets have a
look at an object with a single value property.

 ::

    array(
        'identifier' => '<identifier>',
        'classname' => '<classname>',
        'properties' => array(
            '<name>' => array(
                'type' => '<type>',
                'multivalue' => FALSE,
                'value' => <value>
            ), ...
        )
    )

The value for ``<identifier>`` in Extbase is always the UID of the data record. Together with the class name
``<classname>`` it is due to the uniqueness inside the database. The properties are stored in an own
associative array. The name of the property is the key and the corresponding information of the properties
are the value. The property is signed with the property type ``<type>`` (e.g. ``string``, ``integer``,
``DateTime`` or a class name like ``Tx_SjrOffers_Domain_Model_Organization``) and the property value ``<value>``
it self. The property is declared as single value per default (``'multivalue' => FALSE``).

THe array of an object with a multi value property is basically composed alike. The actual value of the
property is not a simple data type (like a string or a single object) but an array of data types.
This array could also be empty and instead of the array als the value NULL is possible. The property type
for multi value properties is always ``Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage``. In the future other container
like ``array`` or ``splObjectStorage`` are supported. The property is per definition declared as multi
value (``'multivalue' => TRUE``).

::

    array(
        'identifier' => '<identifier>',
        'classname' => '<classname>',
        'properties' => array(
            '<name>' => array(
                'type' => '<type>',  // always 'Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage'
                'multivalue' => TRUE,
                'value' => array(
                    array(
                        'type' => '<type>',
                        'index' => <index>,
                        'value' => <value>
                    ), ...
                )
            )
        )
    )

Has a property a NULL value, so it is stored in the object array like this::

    array(
        'identifier' => '<identifier>',
        'classname' => '<classname>',
        'properties' => array(
            '<name>' => array(
                'type' => '<type>',
                'multivalue' => <boolean>,
                'value' => NULL
            ), ...
        )
    )

The debug output of the return value look like figure 6-13.

.. figure:: /Images/6-Persistence/figure-6-13.png
    :align: center

    Figure 6-13: Debug output of "raw" object data

Maybe in figure 6-13 you have noticed the empty array (``EMPTY!``) of the properties of the organization.
In the domain model the property ``organization`` of the offer is annotated with ``@lazy``.
This annotation instruct Extbase to load the properties of the object not till then if these are really
needed (so called *lazy loading*).

Beside ``setReturnRawQueryResult()`` there are three additional settings for the execution of a query.
All settings are occupied with default values that are set when the ``Query`` object was created by
``$this->createQuery()``. The settings are enclosed in an own ``QuerySettings`` object that you can get
from the ``Query`` object with ``getQuerySettings()``. In table 6-3 you find all settings in summary.

*Table 6-3: Settings for the execution of a query* (``QuerySetting``)

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Setting                       | If this attribute is set (=true), ...                       | Default |
+===============================+=============================================================+=========+
| ``setReturnRawQueryResult()`` | ... instead of the ready build object graphs the database   | false   |
|                               | tupel are returned as an array                              |         |

|                               | (e.g. ``pid IN (42,99)``)                                   |         |

|                               | or for all languages (e.g. ``sys_language_uid IN (-1,0)``)  |         |
|                               | This setting is most used for internal purpose.             |         |

| ``setRespectEnableFields()``  | ... the result set is limited to these tupel/objects that   | true    |
|                               | at the present moment are can be viewed by the current user |         |
|                               | (e.g. ``deleted=0 AND hidden=0``)                           |         |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------+

While the setting ``setReturnRawQueryResult()`` is active by ``matching()`` and ``statement()``,
by the remaining three are only effective by ``matching()``.

.. warning::

    The ``QuerySettings`` object encapsulates specific settings of the 4th branch of TYPO3.
    In FLOW3 as well as TYPO3 5.x the concepts of localization, the access rights and the
    page tree structure are completely different. At the moment of publishing Extbase 1.1,
    this books deals with it, the concepts are not finally defined. For this, the conducted settings
    are not compatible with that of TYPO3 5.x.

Beside the method ``execute()`` the ``Query`` object provide the method ``count()`` for disposal.
It returns only the amount of elements of the result set as an integer value and can only be used in
conjunction with the method ``matching()``. In case of a SQL database a statement of the form
``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ...`` is sent instead of ``SELECT * FROM ...``, which has significant more performance.
The call

::

    $offersInRegion = $query->matching($query->contains('regions', $region))->count();

thus returns the count of offers of a given region.
