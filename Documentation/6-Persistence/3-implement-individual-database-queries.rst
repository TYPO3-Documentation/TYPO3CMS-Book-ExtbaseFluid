Individual database queries
===========================

The previous descriptions about generic methods of queries to a repository are
sufficient for simple use-cases. However, there are many cases where they are
not adequate and require more flexible solutions. On the requirements list of
our application is the functionality to print a list of all the offers. In
natural language, this would sound as follows:

* "Find all the offers for a certain region."
* "Find all the offers corresponding to a certain category."
* "Find all the offers containing a certain word."
* "Find offers that are associated to a selected set of organizations."

There are principally two ways of implementing such methods. On the one hand, you
could request all the offers from the Backend and filter them manually. This is
flexible and easy to implement. On the other hand, you could write a request
matching your criteria exactly and execute it. Contrary to the first case,
this method would only build the objects that are really needed, which
positively affects your application's performance.


.. note::

    You may start developing your application using the first method and then,
    seeing your application growing, veer to the second method. Luckily, all
    the changes are encapsulated in the repository, so you don't have
    to change any code of the Persistence Backend.


You can use Extbase's *Query*-object for implementing individual queries by
giving it all the essential information needed for a qualified request to the
database backend. This information contains:

* The request's class (*Type*) to which the request applies.
* An (optional) *Constraint* which restricts the result set.
* (Optional) Parameters that configure a section of the result set by a *limit* or an *offset*.
* (Optional) Parameters concerning the *Orderings* of the result set.

Within a repository, you can create a Query object by using the command
:php:`$this->createQuery().` The Query object is already customized to the class
which is managed by the repository. Thus, the result set only consists of
objects of that class, i.e. it consists of Offer objects within the
:php:`OfferRepository`. After giving all the needed information to the Query object
(detailed information will be given later on), you execute the request by using
:php:`execute()` which returns a sorted Array with the properly instantiated
objects (or a via limit and offset customized section of it). For example, the
generic repository method :php:`findAll()` looks as follows:

.. code-block:: php

    /**
     * Returns all objects of this repository.
     *
     * @return QueryResultInterface|array
     * @api
     */
    public function findAll()
    {
        return $this->createQuery()->execute();
    }

More repository search methods are available:

.. code-block:: php

    /**
     * Finds an object matching the given unique id.
     *
     * @param int $uid The unique id of the object to find
     * @return object The matching object if found, otherwise NULL
     * @api
     */
    public function findByUid($uid)
    {
        return $this->findByIdentifier($uid);
    }

.. code-block:: php

    /**
     * Finds an object matching the given identifier.
     *
     * @param int $uid The identifier of the object to find
     * @return object The matching object if found, otherwise NULL
     * @api
     */
    public function findByIdentifier($identifier)
    {
        return $this->persistenceManager->getObjectByIdentifier($identifier, $this->objectType);
    }

You must set the `storagePid` to the allowed pages before a query finds any records.
By default, a query only searches on the root page with `id=0`.

TypoScript example of an extension for the page id's 12 and 22

::

    plugin.tx_[lowercasedextensionname] {
      persistence {
        storagePid = 12,22
      }
    }


In the first simple use-case, we don't apply any constraining parameter to the Query
object. However, we have to define such a parameter to implement the first
specified request, "Find all the offers for a certain region". Thus, the
corresponding method looks as follows:

.. code-block:: php

    public function findInRegion(\MyVendor\SjrOffers\Domain\Model\Region $region)
    {
        $query = $this->createQuery();
        $query->matching($query->contains('regions', $region));
        return $query->execute();
    }

Using the method ``matching()`` we give the Query the following condition: The
property *regions* of the object *Offer* (which is managed by the repository)
should contain the region that is referenced by the variable ``$region``. The
method ``contains()`` returns a *Constraint* object. The Query object has some
other methods each of which returns a *Constraint* object. Those methods may be
roughly split into two groups: Comparing operations and Boolean operations.
The first group leads to a comparison between the value of a given property
and another operand. The latter mentioned operations connect two conditions to
one condition by the rules of Boolean Algebra and may
respectively negate a result. The following Comparing operations are acceptable::

    equals($propertyName, $operand, $caseSensitive = TRUE)
    in($propertyName, $operand)
    contains($propertyName, $operand)
    like($propertyName, $operand)
    lessThan($propertyName, $operand)
    lessThanOrEqual($propertyName, $operand)
    greaterThan($propertyName, $operand)
    greaterThanOrEqual($propertyName, $operand)
    between($propertyName, $operandLower, $operandUpper) // inclusive comparison

The method ``equals()`` executes a simple comparison between the property's
value and the operand, which may be a simple PHP data type or a Domain object.

Contrarily, the methods ``in()`` and ``contains()`` accept multi-value data types
as arguments (e.g. Array, ObjectStorage). As ``in()`` checks if a single-valued
property exists in a multi-value operand, the latter method ``contains()``
checks if a multi-valued property contains a single-valued operand. The opposite
of the introduced method ``findInRegion()`` is ``findOfferedBy()`` which accepts
a multi-valued operand (``$organizations``).

.. code-block:: php

    public function findOfferedBy(array $organizations)
    {
        $query = $this->createQuery();
        $query->matching($query->in('organization', $organizations));
        return $query->execute();
    }

.. note::

    If you pass an empty multi-valued property value or an empty
    multi-valued operand (e.g., an empty Array) to ``in()``, you always get *false*
    as the return value. Thus you have to prove if the operand
    ``$organizations`` of the method call ``$query->in('organization',
    $organizations)`` contains sane values or if it is just an empty Array first. This
    is dependent on your domain logic. In the last example, the method
    ``findOfferedBy()`` would return an empty set of values.


It's possible to use comparison operators that are reaching deep into the object tree
hierarchy. Let's assume you want to filter the organizations by whether
they have offers for youngsters older than 16. You may define the request in the
``OrganizationRepository`` as follows::

    $query->lessThanOrEqual('offers.ageRange.minimalValue', 16)

Extbase solves the path ``offers.ageRange.minimalValue`` by seeking every
organization having offers whose age values have a minimum of less than or
equal to 16. Assuming that a Relational Database System is used in the Persistence
Backend, this is internally solved by a so-called *INNER JOIN*. This feature covers all relational
types (1:1, 1:n, m:n) and all comparison operators.

Besides comparison operators, the ``Query`` object supports Boolean
Operators such as::

    logicalAnd($constraint1, $constraint2)
    logicalOr($constraint1, $constraint2)
    logicalNot($constraint)

The methods above return a ``Constraint`` object. The resulting ``Constraint``
object of ``logicalAnd()`` is true if both given parameters ``$constraint1`` and
``$constraint2`` are true. It's sufficient when using ``logicalOr()`` to
be true if only one of the given parameters is true. Both methods
accept an Array of constraints. Last but not least, the function
``logicalNot()`` inverts the given ``$constraint`` to its opposite, i.e. *true*
yields *false* and *false* yields *true*. Given this information, you can create
complex queries such as:

.. code-block:: php

    public function findMatchingOrganizationAndRegion(\MyVendor\SjrOffers\Domain\Model\Organization $organization, \MyVendor\SjrOffers\Domain\Model\Region $region)
    {
        $query = $this->createQuery();
        $query->matching(
            $query->logicalAnd(
                [
                    $query->equals('organization', $organization),
                    $query->contains('regions', $region)
                ]
            )
        );
        return $query->execute();
    }

The method :php:`findMatchingOrganizationAndRegion()` returns those offers that
match both the given organization and the given region.

For our example extension, we have the complex specification to find all offers
that comply with the user's requirements. The requirements are given
via information about the age, the organization, the city district, the category,
and a freely defined search term in the front end. We encapsulate the requirements
in their own ``Demand`` object that basically consists of the properties ``age``, ``organization``,
``region``, ``category`` and ``searchWord``, plus their getters and setters.
In addition to the restrictions for the user's needs, there comes a request
to show the current offers. This example request denotes a date constraint at most one week ago.
In the method ``findDemanded()`` of the ``offerRepository``, the request is implemented:

.. code-block:: php

    public function findDemanded(\MyVendor\SjrOffers\Domain\Model\Demand $demand)
    {
        $query = $this->createQuery();
        $constraints = [];
        if ($demand->getRegion() !== null) {
            $constraints[] = $query->contains('regions', $demand->getRegion());
        }
        if ($demand->getCategory() !== null) {
            $constraints[] = $query->contains('categories', $demand->getCategory());
        }
        if ($demand->getOrganization() !== null) {
            $constraints[] = $query->contains('organization', $demand->getOrganization());
        }
        if (is_string($demand->getSearchWord()) && strlen($demand->getSearchWord()) > 0) {
            $constraints[] = $query->like($propertyName, '%' . $demand->getSearchWord . '%');
        }
        if ($demand->getAge() !== null) {
            $constraints[] = $query->logicalAnd(
                [
                    $query->logicalOr(
                        [
                            $query->equals('ageRange.minimumValue', null),
                            $query->lessThanOrEqual('ageRange.minimumValue', $demand->getAge())
                        ]
                    ),
                    $query->logicalOr(
                        [
                            $query->equals('ageRange.maximumValue', null),
                            $query->greaterThanOrEqual('ageRange.maximumValue', $demand->getAge())
                        ]
                    ),
                ]
            );
        }
        $constraints[] = $query->logicalOr(
            [
                $query->equals('dateRange.minimumValue', null),
                $query->equals('dateRange.minimumValue', 0),
                $query->greaterThan('dateRange.maximumValue', (time() - 60*60*24*7))
            ]
        );
        $query->matching($query->logicalAnd($constraints));
        return $query->execute();
    }

The ``Demand`` object is passed as an argument. In the first line, the ``Query`` object is created.
All single constraint terms are then collected in the array ``$constraints``. The
``$query->logicalAnd($constraints)`` instruction brings together these constraint terms, and
they are assigned to the ``Query`` object via ``matching()``. With ``return $query->execute();``, the
query is executed, and the located ``Offer`` objects are returned to the caller.

The example's offer age range requirement is interesting.

.. code-block:: php

    $constraints[] = $query->logicalAnd(
        [
            $query->logicalOr(
                [
                    $query->equals('ageRange.minimumValue', null),
                    $query->lessThanOrEqual('ageRange.minimumValue', $demand->getAge())
                ]
            ),
            $query->logicalOr(
                [
                    $query->equals('ageRange.maximumValue', null),
                    $query->greaterThanOrEqual('ageRange.maximumValue', $demand->getAge())
                ]
            ),
        ]
    );

This requirement is fulfilled using multiple levels of nested query constraints. Each ``logicalOr()``
condition allows either an unset age (value ``equals() null``) or a boundary
age value. (Here, the minimum age is more recent in the past than the maximum age, on a timeline.)
The ``logicalAnd()`` constraint then joins the two ``logicalOr()`` constraints, making a single
constraint, overall.

You can sort the result of a query by assigning one or more rules ``$query->setOrderings($orderings);``
to the ``Query`` object. These rules are collected in an associative array. Each array element has the
property name on which the sort is based as its key, and the search order constant as its value.
There are two constants for the search order: ``\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\QueryInterface::ORDER_ASCENDING``
for ascending order, and ``\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\QueryInterface::ORDER_DESCENDING`` for descending
order. A complete sample for specifying a sort order looks like this:

.. code-block:: php

    $query->setOrderings(
        [
            'organization.name' => \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\QueryInterface::ORDER_ASCENDING,
            'title' => \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\QueryInterface::ORDER_ASCENDING
        ]
    );

Multiple orderings are processed in the specified order. In our sample, the offers are ordered first
by the organization's name, then inside the organization by the title of the offers, both in ascending
order (thus from A to Z). You can use point notation for specifying the property names.

If you need only an extract of the result set, you can do this with the two parameters, ``Limit``
and ``Offset``. Assuming you want to get the tenth up to thirtieth offers from the overall query result
from the repository, you can use the following lines:

.. code-block:: php

    $query->setOffset(10);
    $query->setLimit(20);

Both methods expect an integer value. With the method ``setOffset()``, you set the pointer to the
object you will start with. With the method ``setLimit()``, you set the maximum count of objects you will
get.

At first sight, using a `Query` object with `Constraint` objects instead
of directly written SQL statements may look inefficient. But doing so here with
Extbase makes complete abstraction of the storage backend possible.

.. note::

    The ``Query`` object leans against the *Java Specification Request* (JSR) 283. JSR 283
    describes a standardized content repository for Java; the FLOW team ported this idea to PHP. You can
    find more information about this at
    :file:`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283`.

Even so, using the method ``statement()`` of the ``Query`` object, you can send a native SQL statement to
the database.

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $query->statement('SELECT * FROM tx_sjroffers_domain_model_offer
        WHERE title LIKE ? AND organization IN ?', ['%climbing%', [33,47]]);

is translated by Extbase to the following query:

.. code-block:: php

    SELECT * FROM tx_sjroffers_domain_model_offer WHERE title LIKE '%climbing%' AND
        organization IN ('33','47')

.. warning::

    You should always avoid making queries to the persistence layer outside of the domain model.
    Encapsulate these queries always in a repository.

    Inside of the repositories, you can access the database using a database connection::

       use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Database\ConnectionPool;
       use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility;

       $connection = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(ConnectionPool::class)
           ->getConnectionForTable('tx_sjroffers_domain_model_offer');

       $queryBuilder = $connection->createQueryBuilder();
       $query = $queryBuilder
           ->select('*')
           ->from('tx_sjroffers_domain_model_offer')
           ->where(...)

       $rows = $query->execute()->fetchAll();

    You have to handle the creation and maintenance of the objects by yourself.

The method ``execute()`` per default returns a ready-built object and the related objects
- the complete *Aggregate*. In some cases, though, it is convenient to preserve the "raw data" of the objects,
e.g., if you want to manipulate them before building objects out of them. For this, you have to execute the
method with its parameter ``$returnRawQueryResult`` set to true.

.. code-block:: php

    $query->execute(true);

The method ``execute()`` will then return a multidimensional array with the object data.
Inside an object, one finds single value properties, multi-value properties, and NULL values. Let's have a
look at an object with a single value property.

::

    [
        'identifier' => '<identifier>',
        'classname' => '<classname>',
        'properties' => [
            '<name>' => [
                'type' => '<type>',
                'multivalue' => FALSE,
                'value' => <value>
            ],
            ...
        ],
    ],

In Extbase, the value for ``<identifier>`` is always the data record's UID. The class name
``<classname>`` and the identifier together make the element unique across the whole database. The
properties are stored in an own associative array. The property's name is the key, and the
corresponding information of the properties isis the value. The property is signed with the property
type ``<type>`` and the property value ``<value>`` itself. The property type could be ``string``, ``integer``,
``DateTime``, or a class name like ``\MyVendor\SjrOffers\Domain\Model\Organization``, for example. The property
is declared as a single value per default (``'multivalue' => FALSE``).

The array of an object with a multi-value property is basically composed the same way. The property's actual value is not a simple data type (like a string or a single object) but an array of data types.
This array could also be empty, and instead of the array, a NULL value is possible. The property type
for multi-value properties is always ``\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\ObjectStorage``. In the future, other containers
like ``array`` or ``splObjectStorage`` may be supported. The property is per definition declared as
multi-value (``'multivalue' => TRUE``).

::

    [
        'identifier' => '<identifier>',
        'classname' => '<classname>',
        'properties' => [
            '<name>' => [
                'type' => '<type>',  // always '\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\ObjectStorage'
                'multivalue' => TRUE,
                'value' => [
                    [
                        'type' => '<type>',
                        'index' => <index>,
                        'value' => <value>
                    ],
                    ...
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],

If a property has a NULL value, it is stored in the object array like this:

::

    [
        'identifier' => '<identifier>',
        'classname' => '<classname>',
        'properties' => [
            '<name>' => [
                'type' => '<type>',
                'multivalue' => <boolean>,
                'value' => NULL
            ],
            ...
        ],
    ],

The debug output of the return value looks like figure 6-13.

.. figure:: /Images/6-Persistence/figure-6-13.png
    :align: center

    Figure 6-13: Debug output of "raw" object data

Maybe in figure 6-13, you have noticed the empty array (``EMPTY!``) of the organization's properties.
In the domain model, the property ``organization`` of the offer is annotated with :php:`@TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Annotation\ORM\Lazy`.
This annotation instructs Extbase to load the object's properties only when they are really
needed (so-called *lazy loading*).

There are three additional settings for the execution of a query.
All settings are occupied with default values that are set when the ``Query`` object was created by
``$this->createQuery()``. The settings are enclosed in an own ``QuerySettings`` object that you can get
from the ``Query`` object with ``getQuerySettings()``. In table 6-3, you find all settings in summary.

*Table 6-3: Settings for the execution of a query* (``QuerySetting``)

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Setting                       | If this attribute is set (=true), ...                       | Default |
+===============================+=============================================================+=========+
| ``setRespectStoragePage()``   | ... the result set is limited to these tuples/objects that  | true    |
|                               | are assigned to a given page or directory in the backend    |         |
|                               | (e.g. ``pid IN (42,99)``)                                   |         |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| ``setRespectSysLanguage()``   | ... the result set for localized data is limited to these   | true    |
|                               | tuples/objects valid for either the default language        |         |
|                               | or for all languages (e.g. ``sys_language_uid IN (-1,0)``)  |         |
|                               | This setting is mostly used for internal purposes.          |         |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| ``setIgnoreEnableFields()``  | ... the result set is limited to these tuples/objects that  | false    |
|                               | at the present moment can be viewed by the current user     |         |
|                               | (e.g. ``deleted=0 AND hidden=0``)                           |         |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------+


Beside the method ``execute()``, the ``Query`` object provides the method ``count()`` for disposal.
It returns only the number of elements of the result set, as an integer value, and can only be used in
conjunction with the method ``matching()``. In a backend SQL database, a statement of the form
``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ...`` would be sent, which has significantly more performance than ``SELECT * FROM ...``.

In any backend storage case, the call

::

    $offersInRegion = $query->matching($query->contains('regions', $region))->count();

thus returns the count of offers of a given region.


Implicit relation cardinality handling
======================================

Extbase supports several types of cardinalities that describe the relationship
between entities - among these are RELATION_HAS_ONE (1:1),
RELATION_HAS_MANY (1:n) and RELATION_HAS_AND_BELONGS_TO_MANY (m:n).

Using these types in individual queries will result in invoking an implicit
`LEFT JOIN` on the database layer. The following sections are using the
:ref:`Blog Example <The-Blog-Example>` to explain what happens under the hood in terms of database
queries. The used entities are the following:

* `Blog.posts` having 1:n relation to `Post`
* `Post.author` having 1:1 relation to `Person`
* `Person.tags` having m:n relation to `Tag`
* `Person.tagsSpecial` having m:n relation to `Tag`

.. note::

    The table names in the following SQL-like examples have been shortened for
    better readability. Instead of `tx_blogexample_post` the real table name
    used in the **Blog Example** would be `tx_blogexample_domain_model_post`.
    Besides that, only the relevant query parts, as mentioned, not all of them.

1:1 (RELATION_HAS_ONE)
----------------------

.. code-block:: php

   $query = $postRepository->createQuery();
   $query->matching(
      $query->equals('author.firstname', 'Dave')
   );
   $posts = $query->execute();

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT    tx_blogexample_post.*
   FROM      tx_blogexample_post
   LEFT JOIN tx_blogexample_person
   ON        tx_blogexample_post.author = tx_blogexample_person.uid
   WHERE     tx_blogexample_person.firstname = 'Dave';

Even if the SQL-like query contains a ``LEFT JOIN``, due to the 1:1 cardinality
this won't lead to duplicate results for ``Post`` entities.

1:n (RELATION_HAS_MANY)
-----------------------

.. code-block:: php

   $query = $blogRepository->createQuery();
   $query->matching(
      $query->greaterThanOrEqual('posts.date', 1501234567)
   );
   $blogs = $query->execute();

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT    DISTINCT tx_blogexample_blog.*
   FROM      tx_blogexample_blog
   LEFT JOIN tx_blogexample_post
   ON        tx_blogexample_blog.uid = tx_blogexample_post.blog
   WHERE     tx_blogexample_post.date >= 1501234567;

Since there might be more ``Post`` entities belonging to a single ``Blog``
entity it could happen that the ``LEFT JOIN`` results in having many duplicate
``Blog`` entities in the result set.


m:n (RELATION_HAS_AND_BELONGS_TO_MANY)
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: php

   $query = $postRepository->createQuery();
   $query->matching(
      $query->logicalOr([
         $query->equals('author.tags.name', 'typo3'),
         $query->equals('author.tagsSpecial.name', 'typo3')
       ])
   );
   $posts = $query->execute();

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT    DISTINCT tx_blogexample_post.*
    FROM      tx_blogexample_post
    LEFT JOIN tx_blogexample_person
    ON        tx_blogexample_post.author = tx_blogexample_person.uid
    LEFT JOIN tx_blogexample_tag_mm tx_blogexample_tag_mm_1
    ON        tx_blogexample_tag_mm_1.uid_local = tx_blogexample_person.uid
    AND       tx_blogexample_tag_mm_1.fieldname = 'tags'
    LEFT JOIN tx_blogexample_tag_mm tx_blogexample_tag_mm_2
    ON        tx_blogexample_tag_mm_2.uid_local = tx_blogexample_person.uid
    AND       tx_blogexample_tag_mm_2.fieldname = 'tags_special'
    LEFT JOIN tx_blogexample_tag tx_blogexample_tag_1
    ON        tx_blogexample_tag_mm_1.uid_foreign = tx_blogexample_tag_1.uid
    LEFT JOIN tx_blogexample_tag tx_blogexample_tag_2
    ON        tx_blogexample_tag_mm_2.uid_foreign = tx_blogexample_tag_2.uid
    WHERE     tx_blogexample_tag_1.name = 'typo3'
    OR        tx_blogexample_tag_2.name = 'typo3';

Since the nature of a many-to-many relation is to be used by various entities,
this will also lead to lots of duplicated `Post` entities in the result set in
this rather complex query example.

Distinct entity handling in query result set
--------------------------------------------

+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Cardinality                             | distinct entity handling suggested               |
+=========================================+=====+============================================+
| 1:1 (RELATION_HAS_ONE)                  | no  | since for each left-sided entity there     |
|                                         |     | is always just one right-sided entity      |
+-----------------------------------------+-----+--------------------------------------------+
| 1:n (RELATION_HAS_MANY)                 | yes | since having more than one right-sided     |
|                                         |     | entity will lead to left-sided duplicates  |
+-----------------------------------------+-----+--------------------------------------------+
| m:n (RELATION_HAS_AND_BELONGS_TO_MANY)  | yes | since having more than one right-sided     |
|                                         |     | entity will lead to left-sided duplicates  |
+-----------------------------------------+-----+--------------------------------------------+

For each of the above-mentioned scenarios, when having distinct entity handling
is suggested, an implicit `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used instead of the
regular plain `SELECT` statement. This does also apply to counting result
sets where `COUNT(DISTINCT <table-name>.uid)` is used instead of a plain
`COUNT(*)` statement.
