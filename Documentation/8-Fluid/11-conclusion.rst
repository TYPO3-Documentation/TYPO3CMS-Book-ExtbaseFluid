Conclusion
==========

In this chapter you first learned the basic concepts of Fluid,
followed by the use partials and layouts which help a lot with structuring
your templates. You have learned about the ``cObject`` ViewHelper
that makes use of TypoScript in Fluid templates possible. In addition you
have seen how additional tag attributes are included in the output of a
ViewHelper. This chapter was rounded up by the presentation of the
``if`` ViewHelper and the possibility to formulate complex bool
terms. Finally we have shown how you develop your own ViewHelper. And at
last we have present all concepts again with the help of an extensive
practical sample - the ``sjr_offers`` extension.

By now you should have a good overview about the different levels of
the MVC design pattern. The following chapter will focus on functions that
touch all 3 levels. We will suggest the localization of an extension, the
validating of data as well as the security of an extension.
