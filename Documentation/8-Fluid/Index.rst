=============================
Styling the output with Fluid
=============================

Up to now, you have learned how to represent the business logic of an
application with a model and how to manipulate the model with the use of
controllers. So far, we have covered the output of data for the user only
marginally. We want to take a closer look at this now. We will show you how
you can create output for the user simple and fast. To make this work most
efficient, especially for TYPO3 and FLOW, a new templating engine named
*Fluid* was developed, which is flexible and extensible,
but easy to learn.

In this chapter, you will start with learning the basic concepts of
Fluid. After that, we will show you some helpful functions while
templating with the help of various examples. Besides this, we show you the
development of a ViewHelper using an example. Finally, we show you how you
can apply the learned technologies with a practical
sample.
