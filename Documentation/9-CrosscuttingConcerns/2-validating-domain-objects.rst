Validating domain objects
================================================

We have learned about Extbase and Fluid in detail, but considered
terms of consistence of the domain only marginally. Often we estimate that
domain objects at all times retain consistent according to certain rules.
This is not done automaticly, so it is rather important to define these
rules explicitly. In the blog example for example we can make the folowing
rules:

* The field ``username`` and ``password`` of the
  user object must have at least 5 characters. Furthermore the username
  must not contain special characters.
* The field ``email`` of the user object must contain a valid email address.

These rules must apply at every point in time for the user object; on
the other way a user object is only valid if it complies to these rules.
These rules are called *invariants*, because they must be
valid during the entire lifetime of the object.

In a first step you have to consider which invariants your domain
objects have to offer. The next point is to put these invariants to Extbase
in an appropriate form. Extbase provides *validators* for
checking the invariants - these are PHP classes in which the invariants are
implemented in code.

We will show you in the following how you can use a validator for the
checking of invariants, and how you can give the user the possibility to
correct an error when an error occurs.


Validators for checking of Invariants
-------------------------------------------------

A validator is a PHP class that has to check a certain invariant. If
the invariant is fulfilled than the validator returns ``true``
otherwise ``false``. In Extbase all validators have to implement
the interface
:class:`Tx_Extbase_Validation_Validator_ValidatorInterface`.
In this interface some are methods defined. The most important is called
``isValid($object)``. An object or value is passed over to it and
it must return ``true`` when the object or value is valid,
otherwise it returns ``false``. There are some more methods in
the :class:`ValidatorInterface` to make it possible to pass
settings and poll error messages. We recommend to inherit all validators
from the
:class:`Tx_Extbase_Validation_Validator_ValidatorInterface`,
because you get a default implemetation of the helper methods and you only
have to implement the :code:`IsValid()` method.

.. tip::

	You will find the complete reference of the
	:class:`ValidatorInterface` in Appendix B.

For example, a validator which checks whether the passed string is
an email address looks like this:

<remark>TODO: insert code here</remark>

When ``$value`` is a string that compares to a (complex)
regular expression, the validator returns ``true``. Otherwise an
error message is generated using ``addError()`` and then it
returns ``false``.

.. tip::

	The method ``addError()`` expects an error message and an
	error code. The latter should be unique, therefore we recommend to use
	the UNIX timestamp of the creation time of the source code. With the
	help of the error code the error can be definitely identified, for
	example in bug reports.

In the package
:class:`Tx_Extbase_Validation_Validator_*` Extbase offers
many validators for default requirements like the validation of emails,
numbers or strings.



When does validation take place?
-------------------------------------------------

Domain objects in Extbase are validated only at one point in time:
When they get inserted into a controller action. With the help of figure
9-1 we can show at what happens before the action is called.

.. figure:: /Images/9-CrosscuttingConcerns/figure-9-1.png
	:align: center

	Figure 9-1: Data flow of a request before the action is called

When a user sends a request, Extbase first determines which action
respectively controller is responsible for this request. As Extbase knows
the names and types of the arguments of the action it can create objects
from the incoming data. This operation will be descibed in detail in the
section "Argument mapping" later on. Now the main step for us is as
follows: The created objects are to be validated, that is the invariants
are to be checked. If all arguments are successfully validated, the
requested action of the extension is called and it can continue processing
the given objects for example give it to the view for displaying.

.. tip::

	Certainly it would be helpful if the validation is also be done
	during the persisting of the objects to the database. At the moment it
	is not done since the data is stored in the database after sending the
	answer back to the browser. Therefore the user could not be informed in
	case of validating errors. In the meantime a second validating when
	persisting the objects is built into FLOW3, so this will be expected in
	Extbase in the medium term.

When an error occurs during validation, the method
:code:`errorAction()` of the current controller is
called. The provided default ``errorAction()`` redirects the user
to the last used form when possible, in order to give him a chance to
correct the errors.

.. tip::

	You may ask how the :code:`errorAction()` knows
	which form was the last displayed one. This information is created by
	the ``form`` ViewHelper. He adds automaticly the property
	``__referrer`` to every generated form, which contains
	information about the current extension, controller and action
	combination. This data can be used by the
	:code:`errorAction()` to display the erroneous form
	again.

Registering validators
-------------------------------------------------

Now we know how validators are working and when they are called.
However we have to connect our domain model with the validators to define
which part of the model is has to be checked by which valiator. Therefore
there are three possibilities which we define in the following:

* validating in the domain model with annotations
* validating in the domain model with an own validator class
* validating of controller arguments

Validating in the domain model with annotations
-------------------------------------------------
In most cases it is sufficient to validate the properties of a
domain object separately. When all properties are validated with success
the complete domain object is also successful validated; when a property
can not be validated the validation of the complete domain object
fails.

To define how a property of our domain object should be validated
we use so called *annotations* of our source code.
Annotations are machine readable "annotations" in the source code that
are placed in comment blocks and start with the character
``@``.

For the validaton the ``@validate`` annotation is
available. With it we can specify which validator is to be used for
checking the annotated property. Let us take a look at this using a part
of the domain model ``Post`` of the blog example::

	class Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Post extends Tx_Extbase_DomainObject_AbstractEntity {
	/**
	* @var string
	* *@validate StringLength(minimum=3, maximum=50)*
	*/
	protected $title;

	/**
	* @var string
	*/
	protected $content;
	...
	}

With the line ``@validate StringLength(minimum=3,
maximum=50)`` the validator for the property ``$title`` is
specified. In paranthesis the parameter for the validator are specified.
In our case we make shure that a title of a blog post is never shorter
than three characters and will never be longer than 50
characters.

Which validator class is to be used? Extbase looks for a validator
class using
``Tx_Extbase_Validation_Validator_*ValidatorName*Validator``.
Using the above given annotation ``@validate StringLength`` the
validator
:class:`Tx_Extbase_Validation_Validator_StringLengthValidator`
is used.

When you have created your own validator to check the invariants
you can use it in the ``@validate`` annotation using the full
class name, like shown in the following example::

	class Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Post extends Tx_Extbase_DomainObject_AbstractEntity {
	/**
	* @var string
	* *@validate Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Validator_TitleValidator*
	*/
	protected $title;

	/**
	* @var string
	*/
	protected $content;
	...
	}

Here we validate the property ``$title`` with the
:class:`Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Validator_TitleValidator`.
This validator class now can check any invariants. For example, the
validator shown in the following listing checks whether the title of a
blog post is always build-on the scheme *Maintopic:
Title*:

<remark>TODO: insert code here</remark>

Now you have seen how you can validate particular properties of
the domain model. The next section shows to you, how complex domain
objects are to be validated.


Validating in the domain model with an own validator class
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The just introduced possibilities to register validators in the
model is sepecially practical when individual properties of the model
are to be validated. Sometimes it is necessary to validate the
relationship between two or more properties of a model class. For
example for a user registration it is reasonable that in the user object
the property ``$password`` and ``$passwordConfirmed``
exists which should be identical. Therefore the individual validators
for ``$password`` respectively
``$passwordConfirmation`` can not help, because they have no
access to each other. You need a option to validate a domain object
*as a whole*.

For this you can implement an own validator class for every object
in the domain model which validates the object as a whole and with it
access to all object properties is possible.

Important hereby is the correct naming convention. If you need a
validator for the class
:class:`Tx_ExtbaseExample_Domain_Model_User` it must be
implemented in the class
:class:`Tx_ExtbaseExample_Domain_Validator_UserValidator`.
The name of the validator for a model object is incidental by replacing
the namespace ``Model`` with ``Validator`` and also
append ``Validator``. When following the naming convention the
validator is automatically called when it exists.

Equipped with this knowledge we can implement the
``UserValidator`` which compares ``$password`` with
``$passwordConfirmation``. At first we must check if the given
object is of the type ``user`` - after all the validator can be
called with any object and has to return ``false`` in such
case::

	class Tx_ExtbaseExample_Domain_Validator_UserValidator extends Tx_Extbase_Validation_Validator_AbstractValidator {
	public function isValid($user) {
	if (! $user instanceof Tx_ExtbaseExample_Domain_Model_User) {
	$this->addError('The given Object is not a User.', 1262341470);
	return FALSE;
	}
	return TRUE;
	}
	}

So, if ``$user`` is not an instance of the user object an
error message is directly created with ``addError()``. The
validator does not validate the object any further but returns
``false``.

.. tip::

	The method ``addError()`` gets two parameters - the
	first is an error message string while the second is an error number.
	The Extbase developers always uses the current UNIX timestamp when
	calling ``addError()``. By this it is secured that the
	validation errors can be unique identified.

Now we have created the foundation of our validator and can start
with the proper implementation - the check for equality of the
passwords. This is made quickly::

	class Tx_ExtbaseExample_Domain_Validator_UserValidator extends Tx_Extbase_Validation_Validator_AbstractValidator {
	public function isValid($user) {
	if (! $user instanceof Tx_ExtbaseExample_Domain_Model_User) {
	$this->addError('The given Object is not a User.', 1262341470);
	return FALSE;
	}
	if ($user->getPassword() !== $user->getPasswordConfirmation()) {
	$this->addError('The passwords do not match.', 1262341707);
	return FALSE;
	}
	return TRUE;
	}
	}

Because we have access to the complete object the checking
for equality of ``$password`` and
``$passwordConfirmation`` is very simple now.

Now we have got to know two possibilities how validators can be
registered for our domain objects: directly in the model via
``@validate`` annotation for single properties and for complete
domain objects with an own validator class.

The illustrated validators until now are always executed when a
domain model is given as parameter to a controller action - that is for
all actions. Sometimes it is desired to initiate the validation only
when calling special actions. How this can be done we will see in the
next section.



Validating of controller arguments
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to validate a domain object only when calling a
special action you have to define validators for individual arguments.
Therefore a slightly modified form of the ``@validate``
annotation can be used which is set in the comment block of the
controller action. It has the format ``@validate
*[variablename] [validators]*``, in the example
below it is ``$pageName`` :class:`Tx_MyExtension_Domain_Validator_PagenameValidator`::

	/**
	* Creates a new page with a given name.
	*
	* @param string $pageName THe name of the page which should be created.
	* *@validate $pageName Tx_MyExtension_Domain_Validator_PageNameValidator*
	*/
	public function createPageAction($pageName) {
	...
	}

Here the parameter ``$pageName`` is checked with an own
validator.



Interaction of validators
-------------------------------------------------

Now you know three possibilities how validators are to be
registered. For an argument of an action the following validators are
called:

* The data types of the (primitive) arguments are checked.
  When a parameter is defined with ``@param float`` as a
  floating number then the validator checks this. When you want to
  disable the type validation for an argument, you have to declare
  the type as ``mixed``.
* All ``@validate`` annotations of the domain model are evaluated.
* The validator class of the domain object is called when it exists.
* More validators that are defined in the action with
  ``@validate`` are called.

Lets have a look at the interaction once more with an
example::

	/**
	* Creates a website user for the given page name.
	*
	* @param string $pageName The name of the page where the user should be created.
	* @param Tx_ExtbaseExample_Domain_Model_User $user The user which should be created.
	* *@validate $user Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Validator_CustomUserValidator*
	*/
	public function createUserAction($pageName, Tx_ExtbaseExample_Domain_Model_User $user) {
	...
	}

Here the following things are validated: ``$pageName``
must be a *string*. The data type of the
``@param`` annotation is validated. For ``$user`` all
``@validate`` annotations of the model are validated. Also the
``Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Validator_UserValidator`` is called if
it exists. Beyond that the validator
``Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Validator_CustomUserValidator`` is used
to validate ``$user``.

In some use cases it is reasonable that *inconsistent
domain objects* are gives as arguments. That can be the case
for multi page forms, because after filling the first page the domain
object is not complete. In this case you can use the annotation
``@dontvalidate *$parameter*``. This
prevents the processing of the ``@validate`` annotations in the
domain model and calling the validator class of the domain
object.




Case study: Edit an existing object
-------------------------------------------------

Now you know all building blocks you need to edit a blog object with
a form. Hereby the edit form should be displayed again in case of a
validation error. Two actions are involved at editing the blog: The
``editAction`` shows the form with the blog to be edited and the
``updateAction`` saves the changes.

.. tip::

	If you want to implement edit forms for the domain objects of your
	extension you should implement it according to the schema displayed
	here.

The ``editAction`` for the blog looks like this::

	public function editAction(Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Blog $blog) {
	$this->view->assign('blog', $blog);
	}

The blog object that we want to edit is passed and given to the
view. The Fluid template than looks like this (slightly shortened and
reduced to the important)::

	<f:form name="blog" object="{blog}" action="update">
	<f:form.textbox property="title" />
	<f:form.textbox property="description" />
	<f:form.submit />
	</f:form>

Note that the ``blog`` object to be edited is bound to the
form with ``object="{blog}"``. With this you can reference a
property of the linked object with help of the ``property``
attribute of the form elements.

Also the name of the form (name="blog") is important because it is
used as variable name for the object to be send. When submitting the form
the ``updateAction`` is called with the ``blog`` object
as parameter.

::

	public function updateAction((Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Blog $blog) {
	$this->blogRepository->update($blog);
	}

<constraintdef>
So the name of the argument is ``$blog`` because the form
has the name blog. When no validating errors occur, the blog object will
be persisted with its changes.

Now have a look what happens when the user inserts erroneous data
in the form. In this case an error occurs when validating the
``$blog`` arguments. Therefore instead of the
:code:`updateAction`, the
:code:`errorAction` is called. These action routes the
request with ``forward()`` to the last used action because in
case of an error the form should be displayed again. Additional an error
message is generated and given to the controller. Ergo: In case of a
validation error the :code:`editAction` is displayed
again.

As we want to display the erroneous object again it is important
that the ``updateAction`` and ``editAction`` use the
same argument names. In our example the argument is called
``$blog`` in both cases, so we are on the safe side.

Now we get an other problem: Also the ``editAction``
validates all parameter, but our blog object is not valid - we are
captured in an endless loop. Therefore we have to suppress the argument
validation for the ``editAction``. For this we need the
annotation ``@dontvalidate ``- the comment block of the
``editAction`` must be changed like this::

	/**
	* @param Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Blog $blog The blog object
	* *@dontvalidate $blog*
	*/
	public function editAction(Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Blog $blog) {
	$this->view->assign('blog', $blog);
	}

Now the ``blog`` object is not validated in the
``editAction``. So also a non valid ``blog`` object is
displayed correct.

.. tip::

	If Extbase thows the exception
	Tx_Extbase_MVC_Exception_InfiniteLoop it signs that the
	``@dontvalidate`` annotation is missing.

Fluid automatically adds the CSS class ``f3-form-error``
to all erroneous fields - so you can frame them in red for example using
CSS. There is also a ``flashMessages`` ViewHelper which outputs
the error messages of the validation.
</constraintdef>



Case study: Create an object
-------------------------------------------------

In the last section you have seen how to edit a blog object with a
form. Now we will show you how to create a new blog object with a form.
Also for creating a blog object two actions are involved. The
:code:`newAction` shows a form for creating an object and
the :code:`createAction` finally stores the
object.

The only difference to the editing of an object is that the
:code:`newAction` is not always given an argument: when
first displaying the form it is logical that there is no object available
to be displayed. Therefore the argument must be marked as optional.

Here you will see all that we need. At first the controller
code::

	/**
	* This action shows the 'new' form for the blog.
	*
	* @param Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Blog $newBlog The optional default values
	* @dontvalidate $newBlog
	*/
	public function newAction(Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Blog $newBlog = NULL) {
	$this->view->assign('newBlog', $newBlog);
	}

	/**
	* This action creates the blog and stores it.
	*
	* @param Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Blog $newBlog
	*/
	public function createAction(Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Blog $newBlog) {
	$this->blogRepository->add($newBlog);
	}

The Fluid template for the :code:`newAction` looks
like this (in short form)::

	<f:flashMessages />
	<f:form name="newBlog" object="{newBlog}" action="create">
	<f:form.textbox property="title" />
	<f:form.textbox property="description" />
	<f:form.submit />
	</f:form>

What is the summary of what we have we done? Again it is important
that the :code:`newAction` and the
:code:`createAction` have the same argument name. This
has also to conform with the name of the Fluid template
(``newBlog`` in the example). Also the parameter for the
:code:`newAction` must be marked as optional and the
validation of the parameter must be suppressed with
``@dontvalidate``. Finally you can output validation errors in
the template using the ``flashMessages`` ViewHelper when saving
the data.

In figure 9-2 you find an overview of the behavior of Extbase when
displaying, editing respectively creating of domain objects in the
frontend.

	error occurs it is displayed again.

Mapping arguments
-------------------------------------------------

In this section we would describe in detail what happens during a
request before the accordingly action is called. Particular interesting is
this process when sending a form. Because the HTTP protocol (and PHP) only
can transfer arrays and strings, a big array with data is transferred when
sending a form. In the action, domain objects are often expected as input
parameter, so somehow the array must become an object. That is done by
Extbase during the so called *Argument Mappings*. It
makes it possible that as an user of Extbase you not only work with
arrays, but you can change objects in forms or give over a complete object
as *parameter* in links.

Lets have a look at all of this in a concrete example: We pick up
the blog example extension and edit a blog object, like you got to know in
the last section ("Case study: Edit an existing object"). When you edit a
blog you see a form in which you can change the properties of the blog, in
our case ``title`` and ``description``.

The Fluid form looks like this (shortened to the essential)::

	<f:form method="post" action="update" name="blog" object="{blog}">
	<f:form.textbox property="title" />
	<f:form.textbox property="description" />
	</f:form>

If the form is submitted the data will be sent in the following
manner to the server::

	tx_blogexample_pi1[blog][__identity] = 5
	tx_blogexample_pi1[blog][title] = My title
	tx_blogexample_pi1[blog][description] = Description

First of all the data is tagged with a prefix that contains the name
of the extension and the plugin (``tx_blogexample_pi1``). This
makes sure that two extensions have no impact on each other. Furthermore
all changed properties of the blog object are transferred in an array, in
our case ``title`` and ``description``. As we want to
change a blog object, we also need the identity of the blog object. In
order to do this, Fluid automatically adds the ``__identity``
property for the ``blog`` object and fills it with the UID of the
blog.

Now on the server side a ``blog`` object must be created
out of this information. This is the job of the property mapper. His
operation method is shown in figure 9-3.

For every argument it must be decided first whether a new object has
to be created or if the work is based on an existing object. This will be
decided based on the identity property ``__identity``. If this is
not in the input data a new object is created. Otherwise the framework
knows the object identity and can go on work with it.

.. tip::

	When you take a look at what is transferred to the server by the
	new action of the blog example, you will find that no identity
	properties are transferred - in this case a new object is created as
	desired.

In the blog example from above the __identity property is available,
therefore the object with the corresponding UID is fetched from the
repository and used for further modification.

When no properties should be changed the object is given as argument
to the action. So that is always persistent, that is changes to this
object are saved automatically. <remark>!!!Sentence not
clear</remark>

.. figure:: /Images/9-CrosscuttingConcerns/figure-9-3.png
	:align: center

	Figure 9-3: The internal control flow of the property mapper.

In our case not only the ``__identity`` property is sent,
but also a new ``title`` and ``description`` for our
blog. For safety reasons a *copy* of the persistent
object is applied. The properties of the copy are changed as given in the
request, in our case ``title`` and ``description`` are
set new. The generated copy is yet a transient object (see section "live
cycle of objects" in chapter 2), that is changes on the object are
*not* automatically persisted. The changed copy is
given to the action as argument.

Now we have to code in our controller explicit that we want to
replace the existing persistent ``blog`` object with our changed
``blog`` object. For this the repository offers a method
update()::

	$this->blogRepository->update($blog);

With this the changed object will be made into the persistent
object: The changes are stored permanent now.

.. sidebar:: Copies of objects

	Why a copy of an object is created when it is to be changed? Lets
	have assume that the persistent object would be directly changed. In
	this case an empty controller would be updating persistent
	objects::

		public function updateAction(Tx_BlogExample_Domain_Model_Blog $blog) {
		// object will be automaticly persisted
		}

	At first this is very in transparent and difficult to understand.
	Besides of that, this procedure implies a big safety issue: When the
	original object is changed it would be impossible to cancel the
	persisting of the changes. For this reason a copy of the object is
	returned for changed objects, so the developer of the extension has to
	decide explicit whether or not the changes are to be made
	persistent.

We want to assume a refinement of the argument mapping: When a link
to an action is generated and the link contains an object as parameter the
identity of the object is transferred automatically. In the following
example the UID is transferred instead of the ``blog``
object::

	<f:link.action action='show' arguments='{blog: blog}'>Show Blog</f:link.action>

The generated URL contains the identity of the blog object:
``tx_blogexample_pi1[blog]=47``. That is a short form of
``tx_blogexample_pi1[blog][__Identity]=47``. Therefore the
property mapper gets the blog object with the identity 47 from the
repository and returns it directly without copying before.

Now you know the argument mapping in detail an can use it in
specific in your own projects.

After you have learned how you can make sure any invariants of
domain objects, the focus will be directed to the secure programming of
the complete extension.
