Conclusion
==========

In this chapter, we have considered tasks that touch several layers of
the MVC architecture. First, we have seen how to cover extensions for multi-languages
by adjusting static text in the templates and also country-specific
formats like date or time are adjusted. Also, we have shown that also
the domain model itself can be translated. After this, we show the check of
invariants in the model, including displaying error messages in the
template and the possibility to correct wrong entries by the user. At last,
we have shown concepts that apply to the security of the extension.
Important by this is that you have understood what request hashes are and how
to prevent cross site scripting.
