Conclusion
==========

In this chapter we have considered tasks that touch several layer of
the MVC achitecture. First we have seen how to cover extensions for multi
languages by adjust static text in the templates and also country-specific
formats like date or time are adjusted. In addition we have shown that also
the domain model itself can be translated. After this we show the check of
invariants in the model, inclusive thedisplay of error messages in the
template and the possibility to correct wrong entries by the user. At last
we have shown concepts that apply to the security of the extension.
Importand by this is tha you have understand what are request hashes and how
to prevent against cross site scripting.

Now in the progrss of the book you have get to know Extbase and Fluid
intensively. We should not get out of view that these technologies also are
bridges to FLOW3 and TYPO3 version 5. The following chapter contains an
outlook to FLOW3 and the ongoing development.
