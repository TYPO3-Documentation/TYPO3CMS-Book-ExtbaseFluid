.. attention::
   This book has been here since TYPO3 v6.2. By now (2022) it is severely outdated.
   we are therefore in the process of reviewing, moving and removing its content.

   The Extbase reference can now be found in :ref:`TYPO3 Explained, Extbase
   reference <t3coreapi:extbase_reference>`. New tutorials are to be written.

The original version of this manual was a hardcover book in German with
the title "Zukunftssichere TYPO3-Extensions mit Extbase und Fluid" by
Jochen Rau and Sebastian Kurfürst.
This book was translated into English by the TYPO3 community.

The latest version of the book (second edition) targeted TYPO3 v6.2.

Meanwhile, the book is no longer an exact translation. Several
the TYPO3 community made changes to reflect
considerable changes in the TYPO3
Core, some parts were removed, added, or moved to other manuals.
It has - in parts - been completely rewritten.

.. todo: add some thanks to other contributors?

Thanks From Jochen and Sebastian
--------------------------------

Above all, we want to thank our families and partners for their
understanding and their support when we spent our afternoons and evenings
with the book instead of with them. Also, our customers had to be patient
from time to time, when we developed Extbase or wrote the book instead
of working on their project.

TYPO3 would not exist without the dedication and vision of Kasper
Skårhøj and without the tireless work of all community members, especially
the TYPO3 Core Team. Here, we specifically want to thank the members who
discovered and implemented many future-proof technologies for TYPO3 v6.
Extbase would not be possible without this inspiration and
these guidelines.

Also, when creating the book, we had generous support: a thank you
goes to Patrick Lobacher, as he wrote the section about Object
Oriented Programming.

Our special thanks go to our editors, Alexandra Follenius and
Inken Kiupel, who gave us a lot of feedback and comments on our texts, and
thus had a significant impact on the creating of this book. Also, we want to
thank the many unknown helping hands at O'Reilly, who ultimately created
this book.

Additionally, you are right now reading the English version of this
book, so we want to thank our translators for the dedication and work they
have put into this project over the last months!

Last but not least, we want to thank you: That you want to use
Extbase and Fluid!
